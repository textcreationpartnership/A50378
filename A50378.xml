            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:47039:4"/>might not be altogether Abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in his Speculations, through the whole Series thereof, he hath preſumed, according to his Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to commit the ſame to Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in theſe few Papers, with his Sentiments Thereon: And now chiefly when the Nation hath ſo lately undergone ſuch great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions, and yet lieth under the heavy Preſſures of <hi>Foreign Wars.</hi> And underſtanding your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip hath ſlighted your Eaſe, in theſe Days of Softneſs and Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacy, and condeſcended to take upon you a Poſt, wherein you may be moſt ſerviceable to Their

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT is high time to lay our Hands heartily to advance, and promote the growth, and ſtrength of the <hi>Navy,</hi> when our Neighbours eaſpecially are ſo buſie about the ſame thing; and do make very large ſteps towards the puſhing hard for the Supream Command of the Narrow Seas; which is, and ever, from Antienteſt Hiſtories, was granted, and accounted to be the Right of the Imperial Crown of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Kings have always been very Jealous of any Competitor, or Rival, as an <hi>Italian</hi> may be of his Miſtreſs: And they have not ſpared any manner of coſt, of either Blood, or Treaſure to maintain, and preſerve it,
<pb facs="tcp:47039:8"/>whenſoever it hath been queſtioned; as it hath been often done in former times, as by Hiſtory appears.</p>
            <p>I mean, by Growth an Encreaſe, by a Progreſſion, for all our Neighbour Nations doe ſo; ſo that my Thoughts drive me to Implore the King, and Eſtates in Parliament, That when it ſhall pleaſe God that <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhall be in ſecurity, that they would put themſelves in ſuch a posture of defence with <hi>France,</hi> as to the Naval part, that <hi>England</hi> muſt be content to be at that conſtant expence for many Years; I mean, to maintain ſuch a conſtant force at Sea, ſufficient to repel the Power of <hi>France,</hi> and ſo to continue it in a conſtant action; and never to ſlacken a hand, although the <hi>French</hi> ſhall decline Equipping of great Fleets, and ſhall only keep together a Body of a Fleet to act on a ſurprize of our leſſer number of Ships, which ſhall paſs the Seas together; or elſe to make ſome ſudden De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pradations
<pb facs="tcp:47039:8"/>on our Coaſts, or Deſcents into <hi>Ireland</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> to fill our hands at home; I ſay, <hi>England</hi> muſt reſolve to be at the conſtant charge, of keeping a great Fleet in continual Action, if ever the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hopes to have any Peace or Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; for it is only the <hi>Navy</hi> under its Monarchical Government, as in Church and State Eſtabliſhed, by God<hi>'s</hi> Aſſiſtance, can bring any laſting Peace or Happineſs to this Nation. It might be asked, what ſhall we do with them? I anſwer, It is eaſie to find them Employment, and that they bring in their charges, and make the Nation Rich; and how I will ſhew hereafter. It was obſerved by the <hi>Romans,</hi> in their Conteſt with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> that when the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had given them a great blow at Sea, and Deſtroyed the greateſt part of their Fleet, they deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired of Recruiting; but when they ſaw there was no ſafety for them, without they
<pb facs="tcp:47039:9"/>did gain the Domonion of the Seas, they ſet heartily about it, (and in time) with many hard Tugs, and many great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties gained it; after which the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi> declined, and in fine lay at the Victors Feet; who if they had maintained the Maſterie of the Sea, had never Submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Yoak, but might have found them Work in <hi>Sicily, Spain,</hi> or in their Enemies Country; but for want thereof, had the War brought to their own Doors; for whatſoever Nation hath the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Seas, ſhall be courted by all the World; for it is in his Power, to make any of the Nations in <hi>Europe,</hi> to live <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappy, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neaſie, and in Poverty, and force them to keep the Product and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fact of their own Countries to themſelves, and ſhall not have any Commerce with any Forreign Nations, but at a deer and uncertain Rate; and for their Colonies abroad, will ſoon looſe them: So it would
<pb facs="tcp:47039:9"/>be a very great Policy in us, now in our Wars with <hi>France,</hi> to bid at a very great Rate, at all the Governments they poſſeſs in the <hi>Weſt Indies:</hi> And alſo, to Scoure them from the Banks of <hi>New-Found-Land;</hi> It would utterly Ruin their <hi>Navigation</hi> at once, it being their cheif Seminary for Seamen, beſide their Privateering; but for the handling them, I will leave it untill I have projected or found out a way for <hi>England</hi> to reaſſume her ancient <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Proweſs,</hi> in her <hi>Naval Affairs,</hi> and the Command of the <hi>Narrow-Seas,</hi> which we have loſt in a great degree; or at leaſt eclipſed; the Reaſons thereof I ſhall ſhew in the enſuing <hi>Diſcourſe;</hi> the <hi>Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi> whereof, will coſt great <hi>Labour,</hi> and much expence of <hi>Blood,</hi> and <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;</hi> which, if gained, will ſoon repay the <hi>Nation:</hi> And therefore it muſt not be grudgingly parted with, nor with ſlow and ſlack Proceeding gone about;

To compare our former Actions done, with handfuls of Men, and Crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of Ships, for about Thirty five Years paſt, with our <hi>Bulworks,</hi> or <hi>Caſtles</hi> of <hi>Ships, Multitudes</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> and vaſt <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence</hi> of <hi>Treaſure;</hi> for about Twenty five Years laſt past, and downwards, would find no <hi>Parallel,</hi> but be cauſe of <hi>Grief.</hi> For my part, I am well aſſured, That no <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> or well-ordered <hi>Government,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been a long time in a <hi>well ſetled,</hi> and <hi>thriving Method</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> can undergo any <hi>Material Change,</hi> without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering the whole <hi>Polity</hi> thereof, to be unhinged and caſt aſunder, even as by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

<pb facs="tcp:47039:11"/>is of great uſe in the Affair without, which it cannot perform any Laudible Action: It is even as Salt to ſeaſon, without which it would be inſiped; ſo likewiſe if you put in too much, it will be offenſive; ſo is Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in <hi>Naval</hi> Affairs; if it be too copious, large and intricate, it proves as a <hi>Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> to Ships; It hinders, perturbs, opens the Doors for Delays, Pretences, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of Diſpatches, ſo that the Affair is made Dilatory, Dull, and Heavy in its Actions; thereby to remove which, I will, by God's Aſſiſtance, ſhew in the ſequel, which are the Novels introduced, and what the Antient, that the Good and Evil may appear; and what I ſuppoſe is hurtful to the Affair; and therefore to be expug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and what of the Old Methods are beſt to be retained, and what New; that the Affair may reaſume its Renown and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Glory in the doing, which I ſhall be forced to open the Doors, almoſt of every

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47039:20"/>will ſtrive to promote and advance, all that are of that Party he does lean to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and wavers in his Judgment to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others: And when he has the Scale of Juſtice in his Hand, and the Party he favours not, has ſufficiently over-ballanced it, yet his Hand will be apt to ſhake, and give it a Tip the other way: I ſay, a Perſon that has been a favourer of thoſe that have oppugned the well-ordered, and well-ſetled Church, the well-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, Moderate, and Free Monarchy; The Subjects, I ſay, of this Monarchy, are Free Men, and not Slaves; Impriſoned, Judged, and Condemned, by their own Parity, and by no other Laws than their own Repreſentatives makes, whom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves chooſe; which Government is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, and wiſhed for in other Countries; I ſay, That Perſon will never Deal any Trumps to any Hand but to his own Party: Whereas Unity and Concord in any Polity, or great Affair, agrees with the Health
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47039:21"/>and Welfare thereof; but Diſcord and Diviſion, I am ſure, tends to nothing but to Diſtraction and Confuſion. The old Maxim to <hi>Don Juan de Auſtria,</hi> in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> (of <hi>Divide and Rule</hi>) is not applicable here. So that Diviſion in any Polity muſt needs weaken; and on the other ſide, Union begets Vigour and Strength. As for Example, If a Man had a great Family, and great Affairs go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, or ſome great Machin to make or manage, I ſhould wonder, if he ſhould chooſe for his principal Inſtruments, Men of different minds, in moſt material Points, whereby a Man is diſtinguiſhed from a Brute, <hi>viz.</hi> his Opinion of his Maſters Government of his Family, both in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals and in Temporals; for if he wavers in that Opinion, he can never be a good Inſtrument in that Machin: But as his Degree or Magnitude in that Affair is, ſo will he the more or leſs clog and hinder the Affair. As for Example, What was
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47039:21"/>deſigned by God Almighty at <hi>Babel,</hi> by altering their Languages, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found their Works? It is indeed inferred there, that inſtead of Bricks they brought Mortar, whereby we underſtand it as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued only in the Labourers. But may we not infer, that the Overſeers and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals were alſo confounded? And may we not conclude, That the greater the Poſt is of the Diſſenting Party, the more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable he is to bring or cauſe Confuſion and Deſtruction? I am ſure, in any leſs Affair it is alſo true. If a Man keep but two Servants to Work, if they alwaies differ and fall out in their Opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Maſter, his Work goes on but ſlowly, and not with any good luck, nor can he hope to proſper; wherefore he were better to part with one of them, and take in another that is ſuitable to his mind, in his opinion agreeable to the former: Then will ſome be apt to ſay, That now he is like to thrive worſe; for
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47039:22"/>they agreeing ſo well in their Opinion of their Maſter, in Spirituals and Temporals, that let the one do never ſo much damage to his Maſters Service, the other will never diſcover it; and ſo will they knit together in the ſin of wronging their Maſter. But the other Party before, who differed, is of a melancholly ſerious Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, full of thoughts, and but vainly te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious of his own Opinion of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. But notwithſtanding that, he is a true Servant, and will follow his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs diligently, and neither do, nor ſuffer to be done, any wrong to his Maſter; a modeſt Man, for you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Juſtice, the ſmalleſt things will not paſs by him, much more the greater; and his tenderneſs of Conſcience proceeds from his Religious Mind. And a great deal more ſuch ſtuff, and kind of ſayings, may be objected againſt Unity or Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of Perſons, in the moſt material points of a Chriſtian, towards their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47039:22"/>or Governour. This is ſuch counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Ware, as hath been put upon the World ſo often, and ſo long already, (and known to be ſuch) that I do admire in my heart, that it dares to appear any more, (I hope, it will not.) But yet out of the confidence it ever hath aſſumed, and obſerved to be well furniſhed with, and ſtill laying hold of that Jeſuitical Maxim, <hi>viz.</hi> That never let any denial ſlacken your paces, ſtill, towards the attempting to be neareſt, the greateſt, and important Affairs, and in it, if it be poſſible; ſo that, let what will be uppermoſt in the State, yet in points of Spirîtuals, if it erect a Chappel, be ſure to purchaſe a chief Scat in it; that he might appear a principle Member, but only to be in a Capacity to ſerve the Party; whoſe over nice Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences will well reward their Jeſuitical or Phariſaical Diſſembler, with Huzza's of the Mobile, and applaud his Perſon in a Crowd, for that which they are told by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47039:23"/>ſome Body of him, of his Wiſdom, Juſtice and Piety (of which he may neither be guilty, nor they care to know the Truth of what they ſay:) But this is all the while Trick, Intriegue, and Deſign, which hath gulled the World, and the greateſt Men thereof; they being not deep-Sighted enough to eſpy it; but meerly Chouſed them of their own Reaſon and Juſtice, and put upon them that falſe and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Maxim, of, Let the Maſter of that great Affair, never take care of the ſaid Servant, who had the right Opinion of him; but he being in the right Road, and a true Work-horſe in the Team, give him little or no Meat, never ſtroak him; yet he will continue to Labour in his right Road, to his Lives end: But the other Servant, the Melancholly, modeſt, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Servant, as he was ſtiled even now; he muſt have the beſt Perferment; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as a Reſty Jade in a Team, he muſt be well Fed, have the beſt Harneſs, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47039:23"/>be well Stroaked, or elſe he will Kick and Fling, Strike at the Maſter, Start out of the way, pull Backwards rather than For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and out of his Sullen and Dogged nature, overthrow the Load, altho it be to his own Ruine: But this is a very wrong Policy, not void of Injuſtice, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence and Indiſcretion, altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politick, and long ſince experienced upon the firſt Broachers and Practiſers of it: I will only affirm this, That the Man who is an honeſt, well-Deported, Temperate Man, capable of the buſineſs, Religious, according to the Eſtabliſhed Government of the Church, and alſo of the State, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Starting nor Wavering; an Aſſertor of the moderate Monarchy of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as by Antient Laws ſetled, is the beſt, and moſt likely to do the Publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, without diſquieting the Affair, void of all Trick, Intriegue, or Deſign; and the more Knowing, Able, and Juſt Men of ſuch kind, are put into the Affairs of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47039:24"/>the <hi>Navy,</hi> the better will it Proſper, and come into a Regular Government: And let Party-makers, Trickers, Deſigners, and ſuch as carry half Faces, or, as I may ſay, changeable with the Times, let them know, that no Man in his right Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, can deem them to be either Honeſt, Juſt, or Good Men, or of any Religion; whoſe Vertues lies hid in ſelf-intereſt, which is the very Bane of all Governments of Kingdoms or States, Bodies Politick, Military and Civil.</p>
               <p>Now, I ſay, if private Intereſt ſhall rule the Roaſt in this great Affair, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Glory and Welfare of the Nation does depend, and Offices ſhall be diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of to Friends and Relatives, or for Lucre, Bribery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then may any one Judge, what Able, Qualified, Honeſt, and Juſt Perſons will Trump up at ſuch Terms; for the beſt and moſt deſerving Men, will never buy their Chains and Fetters at ſuch Rates (for ſo I may term
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47039:24"/>them:) For he that takes an Employment, or Office of Truſt upon him, if he be a juſt and good Man, muſt reckon himſelf Bound, as I may ſay, in the Nature and Stile as an Apprentice to the King, in that Affair; and thus his Terms runs, and muſt be Imployed to ſerve the King, Night and Day, in that Affair, and never to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelf without the leave or Conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of his Superior Officer, nor to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of any of his Time or Service to any other Maſter or Service; and for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to have ſuch Allowaoce of Wages, Diet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now, if this Man does Honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Faithfully, ſo ſerve his ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter both by Day and Night, neither Purloyning, Stealing, Waſting, nor Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezeling his ſaid Maſters Goods, nor to his Power ſuffer it to be done by others, but hinder the ſame, nor frequent Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns, Tipling-houſes, Gameings, nor uſe Curſing, Swearing, nor any Lewd Living; but, in all things, behave himſelf as an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47039:25"/>Juſt, and Good Servant, which I think is near the Words and Import of an Indenture, and is alſo well near the duty of every one that enters into, or takes upon him a Publick Office or Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Truſt, where Wages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed: I ſay, if he does diſcharge his ſaid Duty, he may very well deſerve his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of Wages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> affixed or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to his ſaid Office by the Admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and not to ſpend much Time and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys to make Intereſt, and Fee largely for it, to come in by private Intereſt; but to ſtudy faithfully to ſerve, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to be well skilled in the Affair, and to wait in his Station patiently for his Advancement by his merit unto ſome higher degree, when it ſhall happen to fall, by either the Death or Removal of his ſuperior Officer; for this is a ſure rule that the worſt Officer; for this is a ſure rule for the Betts, knowing that he dares not come to the Touch or Proof of his Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47039:25"/>and it is implyed at the ſame time of his compact, that he may Purloine, Steal, Embezle, and do Wrong to his Maſters Goods, or any other, that ſhall come under his reach, to benefit himſelf, to pay himſelf of whatſoever Monies, Time and Friends has coſt him in the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit thereof; and is ſo <hi>ment by his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior,</hi> to have a larger Tither or Scope to do it, without being turned out, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for it; or elſe he is very unjuſt to him, and in plain Terms, hath Cozened him of his Moneys, Treats, Obſequious Obſervances, and ſlaviſh Attendance; for it is a ſure rule, that the Judge that buyes his Commiſſion, will ſell Juſtice to repay himſelf; which puts me in mind of what I have Read in the old Manuſcripts, of the Kings Houſe-hold Servants; That the Lord <hi>Steward,</hi> and Lord <hi>Chamberlain</hi> of the Houſe-hold, in their reſpective Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts, did declare in a Written Table of <hi>Eſtabliſhments,</hi> what Office was next to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47039:26"/>ſupply the Vacancy, either by Death, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, or Removal of the next above it. In which order, as long as it was kept and obſerved, it appeared to be an orderly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, excellent, and beautiful in its Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and ſerved for the purpoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, <hi>viz.</hi> the Service of their Maſter, the Glory, Beauty, and Splendor of the Court; and hath been ſaid thereof, by Foreigners ſeeing it, as the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> ſaid of <hi>Solomon, Happy are theſe thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that ſtand before thee, to hear thy Wiſdom, and ſee this Order.</hi> But what Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption hath brought it to ever ſince, is not difficult to relate: So ſay I of the <hi>Navy;</hi> if the like Order were made and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and ſuch a known method were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred in every Office of moment, it would be a great Settlement, (as it hath been formerly) it would be an encouragement to all Officers to be Honeſt, Painful, and Juſt in their reſpective Stations; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be approved and experienced
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47039:26"/>Men for their Abilities; and not to grind and extort Fees for Reward, and to raiſe their Profits by Intricacies, and dilatory Pretences, for to bring about their Deſigns, to enrich themſelves betimes, leſt they ſhould be turned out, and not be able to live afterwards: But to wait patiently, and expect to riſe by their Merit unto bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Preferment, as their lot of Succeſſion ſhall happen; and not fear to be turned aſide, and be put out of their Livelihoods, if they faithfully act in their ſtation; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' ſome are offended at them, and by their private Picque ſhall inform againſt them, and ſo be diſmiſt for doing their very Duty; and never ſo much as have an Hearing, or ſo much as know for what they are turned out, as of late years it hath been practiſed. Such Proceedings, I am ſure, is beſide Juſtice; and that no Man but would endeavour to avoid ſuch a Lot, by breaking the Rules and Methods which are preſcribed them (when they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47039:27"/>know it will be their fate, if they do not violate their Orders to pleaſe ſome men.)</p>
               <p>But heretofore it always was the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, if any one had done a Crime wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of being diſcarded, they were ſent for, and permitted to anſwer their Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and had that Juſtice done them, which the Antient <hi>Romans</hi> uſed, as is mentioned in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles;</hi> and not to proceed to Judgment, until the Accuſers came Face to Face; yet they were Heathens.</p>
               <p>Now, I have farthermore to offer, That if Officers have Commiſſions or Warrants granted them, and have not at the ſame time given them ample and ſufficient Inſtructions to act by, in their Execution of the ſame, (in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of which they ſhall be ſafe and blameleſs, altho any Superior be offended;) and alſo if Inſtructions be given to one Officer to Act thus, and to another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to make no mention of his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47039:27"/>to the former; but that their Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are as different, and as contrary, as Light is to Darkneſs.</p>
               <p>It certainly muſt be, inſtead of procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Unity and Concord, a caſting a Stumbling-block into the Affair; and be a cauſe of many to fall either into Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and Diviſions, which is a vexation to them, and an hinderance to the Affair; or elſe under the guilt of breaking or laying aſide their Inſtructions, and act according to the pleaſure of their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior; then ſay I, Rules and Methods are of no farther uſe; and the Service rendred only to truckle to the will and pleaſure of the Superior; the evil whereof will not be ſmall. So that the Affair muſt of neceſſity prove to be the Expence of vaſt Treaſure; the Service done therein very uncertain, and muſt attend and wait upon the Humour, Profit, or Pleaſure, of every individual Commander, or Superior Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, of a Fleet, Office, or Ship; which
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47039:28"/>never was the Proceedings of the <hi>Navy</hi> formerly, nor, I hope, never will be; if it be, it would be the proſtituting the Glory of the Nation to private Intereſt; and the proſtrating it at the Feet of a few, who may, in time, be able to ſhake the Quiet and Felicity of the Nation at their pleaſures; and be formidable to thoſe that Nouriſhed and Fed them from their low Eſtate. Wherefore it hath been ever obſerv'd, by all Kingdoms, States, and Governments, to be jealous of any Army, or Military Power, that they have in their greateſt need been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to employ; to be ſure to bind them to the ſtrict Obſervance of Orders, Rules, and Methods of the King, and his Councils, or his Chief Miniſters near him, to whom he commits the Command of them; he reſiding with him, and in his Councils, and communicates the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair to the King and Council: So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe States do Theirs, to the Order of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47039:28"/>the Senate; and whenſoever their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders ſhall diſobey, or break their Orders, they are immediatly Jealous of their Security, and do not eaſily paſs it by, as may appear in the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; yet they fell under it at laſt: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their Care, and alſo the Care of their Emperors, for the Erecting the <hi>Pretorian</hi> Gaurds for their own Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; yet they expoſed themſelves to the diſpoſe of the ſaid Guards: For how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten was the Empire tranſlated, and the Imperial Crown put upon the Head of whom they choſe: As likewiſe the <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malucks</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and the <hi>Janniſaries</hi> of the <hi>Ottoman</hi>-Empire: So that, I ſay, all Nations have been careful to have their Military Men religiouſly to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Orders, in their Commands; and to have all Officers have their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions for their Duties, in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Places, and their Dependance for Preferment from the <hi>Lord High Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:47039:29"/>under the King, for the Sea; and from the Lord General, under the King, by Land; who, except in very Urgent and Sharp Wars, is near unto the King, and in his Councils: Yet there is none bearing Command under the King, but are to act themſelves, according to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions preſcribed them; and alſo to preſerve their Sub-Officers in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Stations, they acting according to their Inſtructions; for the breach of which they are accountable to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of the <hi>Navy,</hi> who are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine into it, and to inform the Lord <hi>High-Admiral</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, as I ſaid before, if there be not a Harmony in the ſaid Inſtructions, but are of different Meanings; ſo that no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance can be interpreted from them, neither do they ſpeak the particular Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties required of them, but is all left to the uncontrolled Will of the Superiour Commanding; then is the Affair in a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47039:29"/>looſe Poſture, without true Method of Government; and is, conſequently, in much Commotion, diſorderly, unquiet, and diſtractedly confuſed, and at the will of the Superiour commanding, and can attain no Laudable Action; and at a Prodigious, and uncertain Expence of Treaſure; and grievouſly burthenſome to the Nation, and to the Inferior Officers, and Mariners, ſerving under them: I ſay, when ever the <hi>Navy</hi> is under ſuch Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments in its Government, it is running in the Plain rode to Ruine, and the total Loſs of <hi>England</hi>'s Glory, and the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of the Norrow Seas; the which <hi>God</hi> in his Mercy prevent.</p>

               <p>THEY are Commiſſioned by the Lord High Admiral; whoſe Office is to execute all Orders from the Admiralty, for fitting out of Ships, what allowance of Men, the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigging and laying them Up, Building and Repairing of Ships or Houſes; they direct the manner of doing it; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to the <hi>Admiralty</hi> the Quality and Condition of Ships, Houſes, Docks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Qualities and Conditions of all Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, for Preferment; <hi>viz.</hi> Warrant-Officers, if not ſome Commiſſioned: In fine, they repreſent the whole Affair of the <hi>Navy</hi> to the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> and receive Orders from them; which they put, and cauſe to be put in Execution, by making By-orders grounded upon them: They
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47039:30"/>Contract, and Pay for Aſſign-Bills, for Payment for all Stores, Wages, and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, and all the Expence of the <hi>Navy;</hi> and Audite all the Accompts, and avouch all the Payments to the Treaſurer, by a Ledger; which Ledger the Pay-Maſter of the <hi>Navy,</hi> for the Treaſurer, paſſes into the Exchecquer every Year, which undergo the Examination and Caſting again of the Auditor of the Exchecquer; which Ledger contains the Treaſurer's Debtor and Creditor Accompt; which Examination being over, the Treaſurer hath a <hi>Quietus</hi> out of the Exchecquer, for his Acquitment. But yet, in general, theſe aforeſaid Commiſſioners are of very great Truſt; for they ſo negotiate the Affair of the <hi>Navy,</hi> that not an Officer or Perſon in it, but what comes under their Cognizance: Their Office is partly Military, and partly Civil-Military; for they Execute, or Direct, all Councils of War, which in the Roads, or Rivers,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47039:31"/>where no <hi>Admiral</hi> is, they are Deciders of all Controverſies between Man and Man, concerning Debts to be defaulted out of their Pays: They have Power to mulct any Man's Pay, for Neglects and Offences committed: They examine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Men's Facts; the leſſer to puniſh by Pecuniary Mulcts; and the greater to repreſent to the <hi>Admiralty;</hi> and, in the Interim, to ſuſpend them from the Service; and, in fine, to do Juſtice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and the Subject.</p>
               <p>To their Commiſſions from the <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty,</hi> is generally added Commiſſions of the Peace, for thoſe Counties where its thought the King's Affairs will lead them; whereby they are enabled to Act in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Matters, by doing Juſtice no any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to the King's Affairs; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide Matters of Juſtice between any in the Yards, or in their Travels; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any to Priſon for Burglary, Murther, or Petty-larcony; and may ſit on the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47039:31"/>Bench at Aſſizes, or General Quarter-Seſſions: And, in fine, may do any thing that a Juſtice of the Peace can do, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Limits of his Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>And for the Military, he is the very Image and Deputy of the <hi>Lord High Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral;</hi> to put in Execution the Power which the <hi>Admiralty</hi> delegates unto him. And if he be Preſident of a Council of War, he ſits by virtue of a Commiſſion from the <hi>Lord High Admiral,</hi> and as his Proxy.</p>
               <p>In fine, It is a Place of very great Truſt and Buſineſs, and requires Men of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Wiſdom, Juſtice, and Experience of the <hi>Naval</hi> Proceedings; and of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage alſo, and Conduct; for they are many times called to Sea to wear Flags, ſuch as have been made out of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders at Sea, Knowledge, and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the <hi>Navy;</hi> to ſoon decide any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie ariſing between Officers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their reſpective Duties; elſe the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47039:32"/>Officers will be apt to put Novelties, and to raiſe Scruples, if they know the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner is not able to decide them; whoſe Umpirage ought to be abſolute in any of the Yards; alſo when he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. But when there is a Board, it may be appealed to the Board; but if the matter be not very great and grievous, it were better to abide by his Umpirage: For the Others will not care to meddle within his Precinct, concerning any one in the Yard or Ordinary, except they do belong to any Ship in Extraordinary: And though there is a Captain, who will aſſume the Power; yet a Commiſſioner may grant Relief to a Wronged Perſon, againſt the will of his Captain, if the Ship be within the Harbour. But, of late Years, the Commiſſioners of the <hi>Navy</hi> have been eclipſed, and leſſened by the Captains, and the Rules of the <hi>Navy,</hi> and the Antient Cuſtoms, much broken: For the Authority and Buſineſs of ſome
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47039:32"/>have been ſtretched to that length, that they themſelves know not the end; but of that I ſhall ſpeak, when I come to their particular Poſt.</p>
               <p>As for a Commiſſioner of the <hi>Navy,</hi> I have known him to bear very great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the Harbour, and at Pay; and have done great Juſtice to particular Men, who have been wronged by their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders unjuſt and mercileſs Spleen; ſo that the grieved Officer and Mariner have rejoyced, when they have come where a Commiſſioner was; who would take the Captain to Task, for his Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane or Unjuſt Dealings, and repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him ſeverely; and, if worthy, would transfer the Matter to the <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty;</hi> where the Commiſſioners Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation ſhould be heard, to the Others diſadvantage. And if a Ship came into the Harbour, and the King's Affairs ſtood in need of hands, he would not ſcruple to order one Ship's Company to work
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47039:33"/>on another, to clear her for the Dock, Rigg, Re-fit, and what not; by which the Service might be furthered.</p>
               <p>But, as I ſaid before, the Caſe is much altered, and the Hinges of that Affair quite Lame; they will not move any way, except you would have them go Backwards: But I will not meddle with Particulars, leſt I ſhould come within the Account of an <hi>Informer,</hi> the which is reckon'd a thing of great Odium in the <hi>Navy</hi>-Affairs: But I greatly admire, that the Officers of the Upper-Rank ſhould brand any one, that lets them know of any fowl Fact, with the Odium of an <hi>Informer,</hi> and ſeemingly, nay, openly, treats him unkindly: It has ſeemed ſtrange unto me, (and looked like the <hi>unjuſt Steward,</hi> who not only Wronged his Maſter himſelf, but ſhewed others to do it; or looks like a Great Man's Steward, who diſcourages, or is angry with any one that comes to him, and tells him,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47039:33"/>That ſuch an one hath couſened his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or ſtollen his Goods, of which he is the Head Steward;) what might be the Reaſon, that generally, in the <hi>Navy</hi>-Office, and through the Practice of the <hi>Navy,</hi> one that Informs of Couſenage, or Theft in the <hi>Navy,</hi> is ſtiled with an Odium, and generally hated and diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced; as alſo, a Ticket-Buyer, or Ticket-Monger, as they in hatred term him; and is looked upon, as ſome ill Office done by him. But, in my mind, theſe Two Perſons are the King's Friends; the former, to deter Thieves, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Men from their Evil Practices; and the latter I ſhall ſpeak to, when I ſhall arrive at the Ticket-Office. But theſe Treatments are very ſtrange to me, and ſeem, as if there were a general Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt them, as Evil Men, and not fit to negotiate in the <hi>Navy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I ſhall ſay no more at Preſent, but hide my Face with Shame; and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47039:34"/>my Diſcourſe of the Commiſſioners, who are of that weight in this Aflair, that if they be right, and good, and well-fitted to the Buſineſs, they are the Vital Heat of the Affair; and ſhould, as the Action do require, be multiplied, in a great War, with ſome Young, Sharp, Wiſe, and Juſt Gentlemen; who have Travelled, and are of Years for Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty enough for the Affair, and of Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for Buſineſs, to Poſt away to the Ports, where the Ships are newly arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and ſtep on Board, and Examine what occaſions the Miſcarriages, either by Weather or War: And there ſhall he ſee to the Life, Neglects and Miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, in an high degree, by Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Officer's indiſcreet Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And, for want of which Viſit, there is nothing known to the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> but a Letter from the Captain, whoſe Word paſſes at all Times, both for Himſelf, and all the Ship's Company. So the Ships
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47039:34"/>are turned in, and others are turned out, to pleaſe him, without any Enquiry, how the other became damnified. The Cuſtom heretofore was, That before one Ship was ordered in, the Commiſſioner of the Place, or one Extraordinary, as before-ſaid, went on Board, and called all the Officers to Account, and ſurvey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Defects, and examined the Cauſe of the Defects; and, if need were, to take their Oaths to it, if it were of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ſo gave the <hi>Admiralty</hi> an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the whole Buſineſs, with every Circumſtance material. And ſo the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty</hi> knew all material Matters, and, by that means, did ſave the like Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chances for the future; which may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to many Thouſands of Pounds quickly, and Mens Lives, if it were ſo look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after; and would create a greater Care.</p>
               <p>I forbear Particulars, for my former Reaſons; but Miſcarriages come very
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47039:35"/>faſt, and no body blamed. I ſay, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner of the <hi>Navy</hi> is of Great Uſe, if he ſets to it with good Application, and be not baulked eaſily, nor blinded by Commanders; and if he do not love his Eaſe or Grandeur too well, deſigning to ſet himſelf down, and reſt himſelf on a Soft Chair, in a Warm Houſe, with a good Sallary added to it; and not care to contend with the Active Captain. Let him do his Pleaſure, faith ſuch an one, why ſhould I trouble my ſelf with a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, full of Mercury and Sulphur? What need I embroil my ſelf with him? I am in a good Station, and may be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, if I will let things ſlide, and not let my Intereſt be called aloft at every Turn, to ſupport me; and if my Intereſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to fail, I may, by a Miſconſtruction, or a wrong Repreſentment, be called a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to give Room for another, who has gotten a Commiſſion for the ſame Place, before I knew on't. So that, I ſay, if
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47039:35"/>ſuch Proceedings be, that Men are laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide by Repreſentments barely, without ever being heard, it will cauſe all Men to ſooth, cogg, ſlatter, and let Buſineſs ſlide, and nothing will run in its right courſe; that a Man ſhall not know, in a little while, what were the Rules and Lines of Government of the <hi>Navy,</hi> there being ſo little ſign left of them already. For, if it comes to paſs, that the Cuſtoms and Practices of the Methods of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi> be broken by Novel and Unexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Officers, fraughted with ſufficient ill Temper, no ways qualified, but boaſting of their great Intereſts that brought them in, and will Maintain them there, in deſpite of all Complaints; leaving over Methods at pleaſure, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing Juſtice, and ſqueezing Inferiors that do not bend or truckle the right way: I ſay, Such things as theſe will rend the Concern, and peſter it, and be as bad as a <hi>Quartane-Ague,</hi> and ſpoil its
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47039:36"/>Form and Beauty; and make the Nation groan under ſo ill amanaged Concern, by means of its Weight and Burthen, as hereafter will more plainly appear.</p>
               <p>Having ſaid enough, I hope, of that kind Here, I will now proceed to the <hi>Navy-board;</hi> where I find a <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> a <hi>Comptroller,</hi> a <hi>Surveyor,</hi> and a <hi>Clerk of the Acts,</hi> all Principal Officers; to which are added, a <hi>Commiſſioner for Victualling Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts,</hi> and a <hi>Commiſſioner for Aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Caſh,</hi> and divers other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners.</p>
               <p>And, <hi>Firſt,</hi> of the <hi>Treaſury,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Treaſurer;</hi> who heretofore was a Courtier, or Officer at Court, and was of the Privy-Council; and had Poundage for all his Payments, at Three Pence <hi>per</hi> Pound: But it being too large, by the encreaſe of the <hi>Navy,</hi> it was ſince brought to a Sallary.</p>
               <p>He always aſſiſted at the <hi>Navy-Board:</hi> But, I think, the Placing the <hi>Treaſury</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:47039:36"/>ſo far off the <hi>Navy-Board,</hi> is not ſo well for Diſpatch of the Affair; for there might be an Houſe built on the Waſte-Ground on <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> with a Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for the <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> and fit Offices for that Affair; which would be near, and adjoyning to the <hi>Navy-Office;</hi> wherein the <hi>Ticket-Office</hi> might alſo be contained, and be a means of more quick Diſpatches with more Security; the <hi>Tower</hi> being near, and Help ſoon called, to ſtop ſuch Tumults and Mutinies, as I have ſeen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that Office; and the Commiſſioners and Clerks may ſoon be there, to execute their Pays with eaſe, without loſs of Time; and Errors and Miſtakes may ſoon be righted; which the diſtance of it now doth greatly hinder: And alſo the <hi>Treaſurer</hi> need not be charged with the Caſh, no more than the <hi>Treaſurer</hi> of the King's Houſhold is; but as the Cofferer is <hi>There,</hi> ſo the Caſhier <hi>Here:</hi> The Pay-Maſters alſo, being reſponſible Men,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47039:37"/>and giving Security for their Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as they do the <hi>Treaſurer</hi> now, would be ſufficient.</p>
               <p>Now the Caſhier is an Officer that the <hi>Treaſurer</hi> puts in: He receives the Caſh from the Exchecquer, by Aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon ſome Branches of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nune; and ſometimes receives it in <hi>Specie,</hi> from the Exchecquer: But the Pay-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Bills and Tickets, is an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment that the Caſhier has made upon the Pay-Maſter of the <hi>Navy,</hi> charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with the Moneys which he Pays in Bills and Tickets, and gives the Pay-Maſter only Bills and Papers for ſo much; which the Pay-Maſter muſt take care to bring to Accompt in his Ledger before ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>The Pay-Maſter of the <hi>Navy,</hi> is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible Officer, and put in by the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer,</hi> giving him good Security, and Diſcharges the greateſt part of the Affair: They, and all the Sallaries of the ſaid
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47039:37"/>Office, were at the <hi>Treaſurer's</hi> own Charge formerly, except one Clerk for the making up of Books. But how it is now, I cannot tell. And thus much of the <hi>Treaſurer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Comptroller is alſo a Principal Officer, who comptrolls all Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Navy:</hi> His Office is to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect all Summs paid; and, by his Clerks, to caſt up all Bills; the Ticket-Office alſo being under his Inſpection. His Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs being very large, is done by his chief Clerk, and Sub-clerks, and a chief Clerk of the Ticket Office, with Subs. Now, the Clerk-Comptroller ſhould (with the Clerk of the Ticket-Office) be Warranted by the Admiralty. and give Security for the Actions of each Office; and the Sub-clerk only be put in by the Comptroller.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Surveyor</hi> is alſo a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Officer: His Office is to ſurvey all the Ships to be Built, or Repaired; as
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47039:38"/>alſo, all Houſes, Docks, and Stores, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining of Store-keepers every Year; as alſo, the Remains of all Boat-Swains, and Carpenters, coming from Sea; and to paſs their Accompts, which he exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes by his Aſſiſtant, or Out-riding Surveyor; but chiefly by the Clerk of the Survey, reſident in every Yard, and preſented to the Office by the Surveyor, but Warranted by the <hi>Admiralty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I mention an Out-riding Surveyor; but there was never any one yet, nor Aſſiſtant to the Comptroller, nor Clerk of the Acts Aſſiſtant, until of late. But that Aſſiſtant, which I call an Out-ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Surveyor, ſhould be often at every Yard, and where any Ships do put in; I mean, Fleets; to ſurvey any Damages, which any Ships do receive by Storm of Weather, or Accident of War; who ſhould return the ſame to the Surveyor; and he communicate it to the Board, and they to the Admiralty, as I before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47039:38"/>Alſo, this Riding Surveyor ſhould often be at all Timber-Falls, or where any Quantity of Timber is bought, and Marked for the King's Uſe; and not to leave it wholly to Purveyors, of whom I ſhall ſpeak in the Yards: And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, he ſhould be the Meaſurer and Taker-up of all Ships, which are Taken into the King's Service, either for War, or Stores; and not to leave it to Purvey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, as is uſual: Alſo, he ſhould be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Inſpecting, and Surveying of the Ships in Harbor, how they are kept from Drops, their Maſts, Yards, and Rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Ships, whether they lie not, by bad Managing, in a Damaging Condition; and give Orders for their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; and converting, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it moſt for the Benefit of the Service; Alterations on Ships, Hulks, Lighters, and Houſes made; Wells, Pumps, Docks, Conveyances of Water by Pipes; Contrivances of Conveniences
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47039:39"/>for Stores; and not only of the Store-Houſes of the Yards, but alſo of all the Victualling Offices, Cooperidge Dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in fine, all that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to the <hi>Navy;</hi> and not leave it wholly to Commiſſioners, Builders, Maſt-makers, Houſe-Carpenters, and Carpenters of Ships, and others uſually reſident, and acting there. I mean, when any conſiderable Buildings, or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations and Repairings are needful to be made: This being all directly under the Inſpection and Care of the Office of the Surveyor of the <hi>Navy,</hi> and his Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, or Riding-Surveyor; and ſo to transfer the Account thereof, to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy-Board; that they may be able to give Account to the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it ſhall be required; cauſing it to be entred into the Clerk-Surveyor's Office, at the Yards, and then to the chief Clerk-Surveyor's Office, whenſoever any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are made thereupon.</p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:47039:39"/>
               <p>And now it is needful, I ſhould men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one great Conveniency wanting in <hi>Portſmouth</hi> Yard, if not in others; and that is, a large Well and Pump, and Pipes to convey the Water to ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Place, for the watering of Ships at the Water-ſide; that their Boats might at all times of Tide, come and fill freſh Water, their Casks lying in the Boats; that they be not forced to hoiſt them out and in, and roll them in the Dirt, with great labour, loſs of time, deſtruction of Cask, and ſlaving out of the Men; when a tenth part of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and time, and damages, would do it, if a little Charge, laid out for that Convenience, were beſtowed: I admire at the neglect. I ſay, The Surveyor's Office would be of much greater Service to the King in the <hi>Navy,</hi> if it be attended with ſuch good Application, as is herein hinted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Clerk</hi> of the <hi>Acts,</hi> is alſo a
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:47039:40"/>a principal Officer, ſigning of late; but, I conceive, that Officer was never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended formerly to act through the whole Series of that Affair, done at the Board; but as a Clerk and Accomptant, to aſſiſt the Board in their Contracts, Orders, Letters, Warrants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting and Clerking of Matters done at the Board; finding of Precedents, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring and laying up of all Precedents and Papers ready for view, <hi>viz.</hi> all the Actions of the Board, except ſuch Papers as fall under the <hi>Treaſurer, Comptroller, Surveyor, Commiſſioner</hi> for <hi>Victualling,</hi> and <hi>Commiſſioner</hi> for <hi>Aſſignment</hi> of Casks, their reſpective Offices.</p>
               <p>Now this Officer ſhould Sign only under, as Secretary, to avouch he Action paſt by the Board, under his Regiſtry and Notification: For it cannot be thought that he ſhould have Skill and Knowledg in all the Affairs of <hi>Treaſurer, Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, Surveyor, Commiſſioner</hi> for <hi>Victualing,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47039:40"/>Accompts,</hi> and <hi>Commiſſioner</hi> for <hi>Aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>Caſh,</hi> their diſtinct and intricate Proceedings, well ſeaſoned with Juſtice; and to ſpeak thereunto, and to cauſe the diſpatch thereof equally, if not more than them. I ſay, It is inconſiſtent with Reaſon, to think this <hi>Officer</hi> ever was, or can be, capable to attain to the Inſight, Skill, and Knowledge of thoſe Affairs, which is required, and herein mentioned, to appertain to their reſpective Offices; and wherein is the Exerciſe of great Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice alſo: The doing whereof would perplex, moleſt, and make the Affairs full of Intricacies, and troubleſome Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods; and be a means to miſlead them in their Places, and cauſe delays in their Proceedings, or precipitate them in their Debates, when diſpatches are required, ſo as I have elſewhere ſaid: Too much Intricacies by Method multiplied, clogs, perturbs, moleſts, and hinders the Affairs in their diſpatches; which is the Vital
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47039:41"/>Spirit of all <hi>Naval</hi> or Military Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Commiſſioner for <hi>Victual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Accompts,</hi> is to paſs the Accounts of the Commiſſioners for Victualling the <hi>Navy</hi> under his Inſpection; as alſo, the Purſers of Ships; and by his Chief Clerk, who ſhould be warranted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> and giving Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for the Papers, Bills, and all Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Tranſactions in that Office de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending; and to digeſt them into their proper Methods; and offer them to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection and View for Approbation; firſt, unto the Commiſſioner; and, by his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Direction, be preſented to the Board, for Allowances they ſhall agree to; and by their Orders, to prepare Bills for their Signing, and Paſſing the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts.</p>
               <p>The Sub-Clerk, or Clerk of that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, ſhould be put-in by the proper Commiſſioner: But the head Clerks of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47039:41"/>every Office, if they ſhould be put in by the reſpective Commiſſioners, as they have been accuſtomed, as when the <hi>Navy</hi>-Affairs were of leſs quantity, and ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Proceedings; even <hi>Then</hi> it was not void of <hi>Intereſt,</hi> Confuſions, dilatory, promiſcuous, and uncertain Proceedings; much more <hi>Now,</hi> when the <hi>Navy</hi> is ſwol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len to ſo vaſt a Bulk, and a proſpect of yet greater, that it would require to each of the ſaid Offices a Head Clerk, well skilled, and every-way trained up in that Experience and Affair of known Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Juſtice, and Honeſty; diligent and Induſtrious in his Attendence; I ſay, in the <hi>Navy</hi> now: As for inſtance; at the Primier Inſtitution of the <hi>Court of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,</hi> Six Clerks were enough to Clerk that Affair, under which Demonſtration it ſtill Runs: But after the encreaſe of the Practices, how many are there requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and how great and important a Six <hi>Clerks Office</hi> is, doth appear: So alſo
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:47039:42"/>here is Room for Eight Principal Clerks, that none may be delay'd, that attend their negotiations in the ſaid Office, by Pretences and Demurs made by Under-Clerks, or Apprentices, for Lucre: And therefore theſe Clerks ought to be perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, ſettled, and ſteady in their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, with a proſpect of Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that by a Table of Advancement or Eſtabliſhment, for each Clerk's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, as formerly mentioned; and to have their Warrants from the Admiralty; and not to have their whole Hopes and Dependance hang upon the mutable Good-will of the Commiſſioner of that Office: And alſo, the Under-Clerks to be under the like circumſtance of an Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, for their Advancement by the Commiſſioners of the <hi>Navy</hi> Board: So will there be Able, Skilful, Modeſt, and Induſtrious Head-Clerks, giving Security for their Offices, <hi>viz.</hi> the Caſhier, and Pay-Maſter of the <hi>Navy,</hi> Clerks of the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:47039:42"/>
                  <hi>Ticket-Office,</hi> Clerk-Comptroller, Clerk-Surveyor, Clerk of the <hi>Board,</hi> Clerk of <hi>Victualing-Accompts,</hi> and Clerk of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignment of Caſh:</hi> And the Under-Clerks would be Induſtrious and diligent, and all aſpire to be expert, and able inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and be moderate in their Fees, and quick in their Diſpatches, and with patience wait for their Advancement; which is an Object they ſee ſetled daily before their Faces; which ſhould be as certainly their Reward, if they live, and be ſo approved of; even as unalterable, as the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> were.</p>
               <p>The Clerk of the <hi>Petitions</hi> and <hi>Requeſts</hi> is grown, of late, out of the Clerk of the <hi>Acts-Office,</hi> and is a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; and, I think, appointed thereto by him, having a ſmall Apartment; where all Perſons Petitioning for ſome ſmall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatches, may have eaſie and free Acceſs to put in their Requeſts, and receive their
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47039:43"/>Anſwers, without delays; if it be well performed, and not delaid for Lucre; the due Execution of which ſhould be well regarded; for many Perſons attending for ſmall diſpatches, <hi>viz.</hi> to be Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported, and expedited on Board their Ships, Entred into the Yards or Ships, and hundreds more of like ſort, are in need of like diſpatches, and wait there, being ignorant of their Proceedings.</p>
               <p>The Care and Diſpatch of that Office, I reckon, belongs to the Clerk of the <hi>Acts,</hi> or Clerk of the <hi>Board.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Clerk of the <hi>Ticket-Office</hi> is alſo of great Truſt: He is to Examine all Tickets, caſt up the Wages, Examine all Purſers Victualling-Books, keep all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters-Books from time to time, ſent by all Checques, Muſter-Maſters, Captains, and Purſers: If he be a Man given to Bribery or Lucre, he may caſt a great Scandal upon this Affair, and abuſe the King's Service; becauſe the Men's Tickets
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:47039:43"/>are all to paſs through his Hands; and he Acting alone, and apart, he may have opportunities for Protraction: But his Office is moſt immediatly under the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of the Comptroller, but not of the Clerk-Comptroller: He ought to be a Man modeſt and moderate in his Fees, of great Patience, and Compaſſionate of poor ignorant Men and Women; and of a nature eaſie to be talked to, by the Vulgar and Ignorant People; and ready to put them in the Right-way, bearing with their weak Expreſſions, and idle Queſtions about their Buſineſs; and not be of an elevated Mind, ſhort and ſharp Speech, expecting to have Sentences and Rhetorick ſpoken to him: For the People Soliciting that Affair, and alſo generally of the <hi>Navy-Office,</hi> are not much Lettered.</p>
               <p>And now I am in the Way, I will give a Lecture for the Clerks, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, of the <hi>Navy;</hi> who, perhaps, may
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:47039:44"/>come in time to read it, or to hear it from the Mouths of their Superiors, who have the Over-ſight and Correction of them more amplified, and in a better Accent, and more ſuitable to their Capacity, and moſt likely to take Effect upon them; which is briefly thus: <hi>viz.</hi> to conſider, that the Affair is of ſuch great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that the very Welfare of the Politick Body of this Nation does hang upon it; and that generally, the People that act in the Affair, are meer ſtrangers, pulled and haulled into the Service by the Neceſſity of the Nation, to require Help of all People of the Nation, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to withſtand our Foreign Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; to preſerve the Honour and Trade thereof, and theſe People that are drawn into it, either by Force, Perſuaſion, or by Commutation, are generally not much skilled in Letters, and commonly Women-Solicitrixes, Wives, Widows, or Friends; and therefore, very teſty, and very impatient of delays; well
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47039:44"/>ſtockt with Curſes, and hard Wiſhes; yet more than all, are grinded by their Creditors, and pinched to the heart by Poverty, and inſupportable Neceſſities, the which is partly brought on them by their imprudent management of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and Family, when they have it: But, chiefly, the exigencies which the Affair puts them into, <hi>viz.</hi> Travel, Wounds, Sickneſs by Miſchances, Wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Cold, bad Diet, Lodging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet more by the Methods and Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the <hi>Naval</hi>-Offices, whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions goe but a little way, to ſpare Money, or Advice, nay Liberty under their Commands, to provide neceſſary Relief at the beſt hand for themſelves: For, firſt, when they come on Board, they have no Cloths; and to have them, the Methods are not, untill they have ſerved Two Months: But, perhaps, e're that he ſtinks, or crawls with Lice, or Sick, if not all together: And then when
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:47039:45"/>he has it, it is at a dear Rate, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not that which he wants; and none dares to Credit him, as I ſhall ſhew here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, on the Slop-ſeller's Part. But this being too long a Leſſon for my Clerk to hear, I will leave this Subject unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Place; thinking I have ſaid enough, to move him to compaſſion towards the Sea-men, their Widows, and Fatherleſs Children; and to give them diſpatches the eaſieſt, quickeſt, and cheapeſt Way, in kind and Familiar Expreſſions, except they be rude and impudent towards the Clerk.</p>
               <p>And here I will acquaint the <hi>Clerks,</hi> That when we did the greateſt Feats of Arms at Sea, <hi>viz.</hi> with the <hi>Dutch</hi> their Firſt War; with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> St. <hi>de Croix,</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies, &amp;c,</hi> and all the Wars we had in the Time of King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Exile; the <hi>Navy-Office</hi> was ſo ordered, that a Man might have diſpatched any Affair almoſt,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47039:45"/>at one Board; and with the Ticket-Office and Treaſure, in a Tides-Time; and with the greateſt eaſe imaginable, and cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs too: For none were ſuffered to take any Fees publickly, but what was forced on them, and in private, with a modeſt Acceptance: But their diſpatches were with all imaginable quickneſs, and every one endeavoured to exceed each other; and ſtrove who ſhould ſerve the Publick beſt, and cheapeſt: For their publick Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs were carried on with all imaginable Application, and it was a Crime for any one to abſent himſelf from his Poſt, and not eaſily paſt over without very good Reaſons given; nor any kind of delays, by keeping any Bills, or Tickets, or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, in their hands, without diſpatch, under pretence of not being at leiſure: And for their quick Equipping of Fleets, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them into Action, there is ſufficient Teſtimony and Proof remaining. Indeed, it did behove them to beſtir themſelves,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:47039:46"/>when they had the whole World upon their backs almoſt, at once, to deal with; and a diſcontent in their Bowels, at the ſame time; yet you ſee, with what Vigor and Reſolution, Pains and Induſtry they waded through it, to the Terror and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazament of their Enemies; the Situation of this Kingdom, and Benefit of its Ports; but the paucity of their Ships and Men, and ſmallneſs of their Proviſion of Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery and Munition, was no ſmall Obſtacle.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I conclude, that ſince the ſaid Obſtacles are removed far from us, and the Benefits, by <hi>God</hi>'s Goodneſs, continued unto us, (unto which might be added an Heroick Monarch, with good conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Laws,) why we might not, by the Divine Aſſiſtance, do as great matters by our <hi>Navy,</hi> as ever; which might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us both Splendor, Peace, and Riches, I know not.</p>
               <p>And therefore I conclude this Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the <hi>Clerks,</hi> that they be expert,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47039:46"/>painful, and induſtrious, moderate in their Fees; but of quick diſpatches, which is the Life thereof; and I doubt not, but that their Superiours will ſettle them a good Compenſation, ſuitable to their Merit; and an Eſtabliſhment for their Advancement, as a Reward for their patient Expectation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> the Commiſſioner for <hi>Aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Caſh,</hi> is of a late Comencement, but a very good Method: His Office is to inſpect the keeping of a Ledger, by his Head Clerk of all the <hi>Caſh,</hi> aſſigned to be paid by the Treaſurer or Pay-maſter, in the nature of Debtor and Creditor, the Italian Accompt; by which Book the Board may ſee the State of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, what hath been Received, and to what Uſes it hath been paid, and what <hi>Caſh</hi> remains to be Aſſigned: Alſo, he prepares Liſts of what Bills or Tickets, Ships, Books, or Yards, are yet unpaid, and are preſented to the Board, as often
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47039:47"/>as neceſſity requires; that they may agree in the Order or Preference, what is moſt neceſſary or needful to be next aſſigned for Payment, out of what part and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the remaining Caſh; and of the next Receipts, as appropriated for this Uſe, and what for that; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are Liſted, and Aſſigned, and Paid in their courſes, without any devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or preferences, as the ſaid Liſt runneth. If it be Rightly Executed, the method is laudable, if there be no delays nor preferences in the drawing the ſaid Liſts, but impartially aſſigned.</p>
               <p>The Juſt and Impartial proceedings of this Office, is committed to the care of a Commiſſioner; who directs and orders the Head-Clerk therein, and he the Subs, for his Aſſiſtance: This is a Branch of the Comptroller's Office; but his Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being of too large Buſineſs, is eaſed by this Commiſſioner, as is alſo, by the Commiſſioner for Victualing-Accompts:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:47039:47"/>The Other Commiſſioners alſo do contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute their Help, to ſee the due Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Payes of Ships, Yards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They go to the Ports where Fleets ride, and give neceſſary Orders: But formerly, they went on Board the Fleet, and into Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and were of Council to the Flags: For, it has not been thought ſafe, nor expedient, for a general Flag to go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Coadjutors, or Aſſiſtants in Councils. I ſay, they have alſo noted the Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and took notice of the diligent, careful, and induſtrious Officers; and who did a brave Action, he gave the <hi>Admiralty</hi> an Account, for Preferment and Reward; and the Careleſs, Sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Debauched, and Ill-behaved, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo noted to the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> for their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: But for ſome ſmall rewards, and other reprehenſions, he had power to do himſelf, and never failed to do it.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe, in the Ports, Harbors, and Yards, where any quantities of Ships
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47039:48"/>were, they viſited, and ſpurred, enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, quickned, and diſpatched the Affairs, making their Obſervations as aforeſaid: Yet not to Eclipſe the <hi>Admiral</hi>'s Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or the Commiſſioner's of the Place; but all went on in a mutual Aſſiſtance to the Affair, in Unity and Concord; and whatſoever the One did, was approved of by the Other. But a Captain never attempted to Diſobey, Contradict, or Diſpute the Commiſſioner's definite Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, within the Ports or Rivers; nor his Advice or Directions in points of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment abroad, if it were not oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the General's or Admiral's Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: But how it is now, and what Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure a Commiſſioner bears, is plain and obvious in proceedings of late, which brings me into</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Commſſioners formerly, if a Captain brought in his Ship, and was ordered to turn over this Company into another; the Commiſſioner ſeeing the emergency of the Occaſion, and that it was for the Advancement of the Service; and that his Hands were enough to clear
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47039:49"/>the former Ship, and fit her for the Dock, againſt the approaching Spring, or to clean her on the ways; and, at the ſame time, alſo to Ballaſt, Rigg, and Store the other, that ſo the Service might not be impeded or diſappointed, the hands at the Dock prepared, and the Dock to receive her: I ſay, that they be not forced to be imployed another way, and the Dock lie void, and a Ship full of Stores and Tackle lie by, for want of hands to clear her: The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner would immediately, either by word of Mouth, or Order in Writing, order, that ſo many of ſuch a Ship's hands do This, and ſo many That, which was accordingly done: But of late, other Proceedings have been, and clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: Nay, I doubt, to further the Service, the Commiſſioner hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to advance the Money impreſted for the Yard, to pay the Men for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it: And alſo, the Captain to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47039:49"/>to let ſome of his Men to Hoyſt out the Proviſions, which he left in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, to put into the New-fitted Ship, without Moneys to Pay his Men for it; If the Commiſſioner have proteſted he had no Money, the thing ſo lies undone, and the Proviſion lies in the Ship, until his good-will comes, or that he could not Victual the other without it; and, at laſt, ſendeth ſome hands for ſome of it; and the reſt, with the Ballaſt, Guns, and Stores, lies in her till ſhe have ſlipt one Spring; and, with very great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, may be gotten into the Dock the laſt Tide of the Second Spring, the Dock lying empty all that while, and the hands prepared for her, for a ſhift, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſome other work. O Prodigious Proceedings! by one handful may be known the whole Sack.</p>
               <p>How far a Commiſſioner's Authority runs in reſpect to a Captain now, I do not pretend to know; but formerly I have
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47039:50"/>known it extended even to the ordering all his Ship's-Company in Harbor, as he thought good, for the Advancement of the Service: Nay, if the Captain (in Spleen) would under-rate any Officer, Seaman, or Servant, to prejudice him, the Commiſſioner would do him right; and if the Captain ſhould abuſe any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, or uſe any unreaſonable Command towards any Officer, or any of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, upon his firſt knowledge thereof, he would reprehend the Captain; and if that were not enough, he would acquaint the <hi>Admiralty</hi> therewith, and become an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate to procure Juſtice for the wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Party. I am ſure he is ſworn to do Juſtice, as a Juſtice of Pace is, and to act ſo between the King and Subject, in all Matters under his Cognizance; and the like between Subject and Subject, or elſe I am miſtaken. But if the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's Commiſſion be now too high for his reach, I know not, but will refer it
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47039:50"/>to thoſe, who gave them both. But this I know, that the Service is lame, and halts ſhrewdly thereby.</p>
               <p>The Commiſſioners of the <hi>Yards</hi> have been of great uſe and ſervice to the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair; but how they are now, I have ſo late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given you a handful out of a full ſack, that there is no farther need to declare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I come now to the <hi>Clerk of the Cheque,</hi> who is an Officer of great Truſt, and muſters and cheques all Men, both in the <hi>Yard, Harbour,</hi> and adjacent <hi>Roads,</hi> where he can come conveniently, as his Inſtructions import: He caſts up all Mens Wages for their Services; makes and delivers Books for their Quarterly Payment, and checques all abſent time: He makes out Bills for all manner of Stores: He gives Warrants to the Victuallers, to iſſue Victuals to all Ships Companies, both ordinary and extraordinary, called <hi>Petty Warrants;</hi> and he is the Caſhier to pay all Contingences of the Yard, <hi>viz.</hi> Petty
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47039:51"/>Emptions, and all other Emptions and contingent Charges; and the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners Bills, with the Parties Receipts, are his Vouchers, to clear the Impreſt Bills granted him, which are great Sums. His Office conſiſts of many intricate and difficult parts, and requires an expert Clerk; one that knows the Rules and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of the <hi>Navy;</hi> a Man of good Judgment in Buſineſs, ſharp ſighted, and crafty, to prevent the Shifts, Shams, and Coſenages, that elſe will be put upon him; of Skill to diſcern the Goodneſs and right Qualities of the Stores ſerved in; to be vigilant, and watchful, that the Men be not out of the Yard, when they ſhould be at Work; or purloining and embez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the King's Goods; nor be not in their Beds, or at Ale-houſes, whilſt they ſhould be attending the Work of their Nights and Tides, and yet be paid for it: and, in fine, to be a vigilant, painful, honeſt, and withal, a very juſt Man; or elſe he
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47039:51"/>may do many Men much wrong, and diſcourage many good Men.</p>
               <p>This Officer is of that general Uſe, that he had need be endowed with as many good Parts, as can be found to be gathered into one Man; I mean, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments of the Soul; as, Faith, Juſtice, Charity, and all Spiritual Graces: and of the Mind; as Wiſdom, Patience, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fability, and all the intellectual Graces: and of the Body; as, Temperance, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, Labour, and Induſtry, Vigilance, and Carefulneſs; and a true Obſerver of the Methods and Rules of the <hi>Navy</hi> and <hi>Yards;</hi> and no Breaker of thoſe Rules, that are preſcribed him in his Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are, or ſhould be, as a Table of Commandments to him; And, in fine, if he be not well skilled and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as he is in a ſtation of much Service, ſo may he do much Diſſervice. As for inſtance, If he be a Man of no Skill or Knowledg in <hi>Maritime</hi> Affairs, (<hi>viz.</hi> a
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47039:52"/>meer Novice to all that Affair,) no good Clerk nor Accomptant, and in the general of negotiating, and doing of Buſineſs, a Novice; that is Incapability enough to make him uſeleſs, and rather, nay, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream hurtful to the Affair. For, if the King muſt put in Novices, and Pupils, into places of Buſineſs and Truſt, and to endure the Damages that enſue by it, and wait for their improvement, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for it; then Children were fitter for it, they may come to maturity: But if to the other Unqualifications, he be fraughted with ill Temper, Peeviſhneſs, creeping Hypocrſie, Paſſionate, Trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, Malitious, and Revengeful, full of Tricks, Intrigues, and Deſigns, Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitedneſs, angry with one that does not flatter him, and that hath not the ſame opinion of him, that he hath of himſelf; plotting and deſigning to enrich himſelf by new methods of his Office, breaking his Inſtructions like Cobwebs, with
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47039:52"/>whom Lies, and Denials of Truth are as frequent, as Kiſſes at a Wedding; and, in fine, makes every one ſwear to negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate with him, to ſave himſelf harmleſs; except he learn to procure, and have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in his Pocket, the Key to unlock his Temper, to have a diſpatch ſuitable to his Time and Occaſion; I ſay, ſuch a Man is put in the fair Rode to do exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great damages to the Affair: But to particularize the Evils enſuing, were too tedious to number; and therefore I will leave him in the good Conceit he hath, that he that preferred him, will not fail to ſupport him: Let buſineſs either truckle or ſlide, his Ends and Deſigns are ſure to effect. I muſt needs ſay then, that the weight of the burthen is too heavy for the Nation to bear; and will make it groan, if many ſuch are ſhuffled into buſineſs of moment, to ſerve private Ends.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Maſter-Builder, who has the Over-ſight, and all the Direction and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:47039:53"/>Contrivance of the Building of all Ships, Boats, Veſſels, Docks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> under the Inſpection of the Surveyor, and Helps: He hath a ſufficient Architecture, called his Aſſiſtant, Foremen, Maſter <hi>Caulker,</hi> Maſter <hi>Joyner,</hi> Maſter <hi>Boat-Builder,</hi> Maſter <hi>Maſt-Maker;</hi> and all, in their diſtinct Stations, execute his Orders, and are material In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments under him, to carry on the Machines, which he receives Orders for from Above. Yet he is not ſo abſolute, but the Commiſſioner upon the place is his ſuperiour Officer, and may ſuperſede, if he ſees neceſſary; and is an Over-ſeer and Controller of him, and all other Officers in the Yard: Obedience he may command; but let him take care, it be for the Promotion and Advantage of the Service, and all is right.</p>
               <p>This Maſter-Builder, I ſay, is the head of all the Ship-wrights, Maſt-Makers, Joyners, Boat-Builders, Carvers, Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and is a moſt material Officer
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:47039:53"/>of Truſt; He and his Aſſiſtant, Signing for all Materials to the Store-keeper, for the iſſuing them; who appropriates and appoints what Services they are iſſued for, by Notes, or Bills of Iſſues, by his Clerk allowed him, with an Office for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Yet I take notice of an Error in it; <hi>viz.</hi> that although he does give a Bill for the ſaid Iſſues, and therein ſpecifie for what Ship, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is to be expended upon; and the Accounts for that Work are ſo placed on the ſaid Ship, or Work, with the Wages thereon, in the Accompts ſent to the Surveyors Office: Yet it is not practiſed to take the Parties hands to the Receipt of the ſaid Materials iſſued, who receives them, <hi>viz.</hi> the Carpenters of the Ships, Fore-men, or Overſeers of the ſaid Work; ſo that they know not what Orders of Appropriation are iſſued for that uſe; and thereby is left a Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, to direct the ſaid Materials to any other uſe, and may prove a great abuſe to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:47039:54"/>that Ship or Work; and may make it ſwell in the Surveyor's-Office, where the Board has only the view for their Satisfaction, to give the <hi>Admiralty</hi> account thereof: And I may ſay, be a diſeſtimation on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractors for the former Building, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the ſaid Ship or Work, and prove to be an untrue Repreſentation of the Affairs to the <hi>Board</hi> and <hi>Admiralty;</hi> and is an open Door for many Evils to enter at, which otherwiſe might be ſhut: The Evils are too many for me to mention, but may eaſily be conjected.</p>
               <p>And here I cannot let ſlip one great Evil in the <hi>Navy, viz.</hi> That a Ship which has been built out of the King's Yards, when ſhe comes into the ſaid Yards to be repaired, ſhe ſhall be cobled up, and diſregarded, and diſparaged at a ſtrange rate by every Builder, Aſſiſtant, Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, nay, every ordinary Shipwright, in favour and imitation of what their Maſter-Builder ſaith of her; even he, I
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:47039:54"/>ſay, hath alſo a Stone to caſt at her; and all this happens to her, becauſe he that built her is not in requeſt in the King's Service at that time: But if he were, then may he write to that Dock and Yard to be kind to her; and by that is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the meaning, <hi>viz.</hi> to give her due Repairs, and to ſpare no Coſts to fit her forth. But if ſhe hath no Friends, as I ſaid, or Father, (as they call it,) ſhe may be had into the Dock, and bungled up at a ſlighting rate, and turned out again, without having her full Repairs and Adornings, and put on Float to be done there; the which often lies undone, and ſhe is left open for the Weather to deſtroy her: Her Scuppers alſo may be left unſet, whereby the Water runs down her tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers years together; the Bolts undrove; not Coats for the Maſts, nor Tarpallings to keep her dry; alſo not good Caulk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and abundance of Work undone; the which the Builder ſays he can do in
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:47039:55"/>an inſtant; but the Ship being not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be immediately ſitted out, ſhe is thus laid by; and the Builder certifies to the Board that ſhe is ready for the Sea, when ſhe wants two or three Hundred Pounds worth of Work to be done to her; and when ſhe is ordered to the Seas the Work is to do: And ſo do they work over one another's Backs, and hinder each other; which is a loſs to the King, and a great Cauſe why Ships are ſo long Equipping, there being a myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry under it, which ought to be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
               <p>Now all this while here is a Latitude left by this method, as I ſpake of, for the Iron Work, Timber, and Materials, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be ſpent on a beloved or a favourite Ship, as they call it, and placed to the account of the other, who all this while lies Rotting and Decaying ſhamefully, for want of careful Preventions.</p>

               <p>As for the Preſervation of Ships after built, I account it the moſt neceſſary and needful Charges, and that ought moſt eſpecially to be regarded, before the building of new Ships; for every Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds laid out well for Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Ships, is of more Service, than two Thouſand Pounds laid out upon new Ships, let it be managed never ſo well: For I would fain know wherein the Wiſdom and Prudence of that Man lies, who, having two Houſes required for his uſe, of equal bigneſs, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Decay, and that every Hundred Pound laid out upon Repairs of one of them, turns to more account for his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and readier for his Uſe, than five Hundred Pound laid upon a new one: And the other being lately repaired, or built, and wants only ſome ſmall Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be upon it, to preſerve it for his uſe, at all times of need to be ready; and every Hundred Pound he layeth out
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:47039:56"/>upon that's Preſervation, turns to his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of profit more than two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pound laid out towards building a new one; and yet notwithſtanding he will neglect the other, and build it new; for that his chief Steward, or elſe his Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workman, has blinded his cheif Steward, who have large private Intereſts in the building of new, or elſe their Intereſt runs like two Lines from the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Centre. I cannot forbear to be thus plain, that Navy Ships, I fear, have been too much neglected in their Preſervation, and that Builders have not been without their blame; and that no ſmall Intrigues are and have been carried on for the Building and Repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Ships, I am well ſatisfied thereof.</p>
               <p>I confeſs this matter, as many Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of great Weight, and alſo that of the Purveyors, and Contractors, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a long diſcourſe, and would be matter of Diſcovery of divers Myſteries;
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:47039:56"/>but becauſe I have an Eye to my former Promiſe, not to expoſe the Affair, nor any Perſon therein, to the view of the World; and that I do not affect the Title of an Informer; but ſo as to caſt a willing Mite into the Treaſury, for the ſupport of the Order and Government of the <hi>Navy,</hi> whereby it might be eaſier maintained (as to the vaſt Expence, and immence charge thereof) by the Nation, and ſerve the right Ends: <hi>viz.</hi> To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and maintain the Honour and Wealth of the Nation; and by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion to encreaſe it, that they be not obnoxious to the Inſulting, or Conqueſt, of their Neighbours, who deſign no leſs; which is my chief End herein.</p>
               <p>Now as for the Builders, Aſſiſtants, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-Caulkers, Maſter-Joyner, Maſter-Maſt-Maker, Maſter-Boat-Builder, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-Houſe-Carpenter, Ship-Wrights, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, Sawyers. Tool-Grinders and Setters, and all the Artificers and Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:47039:57"/>men belonging to the reſpective Works, being under the Inſpection of the Maſter-Builder, and Aſſiſtants, having not time to deſcend into ſmall particulars, I will ſay no more here: But that the Maſter Carver, Anchor-Smith, Lock-Smith Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Purveyor of ſmall Stores, or petty Emptions, they being all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractors, I will ſay only as I before ſaid of the right Appropriations of the Stores, and true Qualifications therof, that the Door be ſhut againſt any Evils that may come in by Fraud, or wrong Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſaid Works: which brings me,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FOurthly,</hi> to the Storekeeper's-Office, who is alſo of great Truſt in his Receipts and Iſſues of all manner of Stores; who gives alſo Security for his Office, to paſs his Accompts, Debtor and Creditor, with the Clerk-Surveyor, or with the Clerk of the Comptroll, which was an Officer ſettled of late years in every Yard, and a Head-Office thereof at <hi>London.</hi> And
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:47039:57"/>therein was found out an Employment for a Commiſſioner of the Board; but that being onely a Branch of the Survey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or's Office, it never appeared to me of any uſe; but as hiring Men to mud the Water, ſo it hath been for ſome time ſince diſcontinued at the Yards: But the Office aloft is continued; where many Lines and Columns of Stores are made, for the balancing of Store-keepers Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts: Yet that heretofore, and now, ought to be kept by the Clerk-Surveyor; but he finding eaſe thereby, may be ſilent. The Storekeeper, I ſay, with his Clerks and Subs, are to be minded, that he, nor any of his Inſtruments, ſhall be negligent in their attendance, but be ready to make Diſpatch in their Iſſues, and not to be moroſe and ſhort in their Anſwers, and prolong the time in effecting the Import of the Notes and Bills, that are ſigned to them by the Maſter-Builder, his Aſſiſtant, Maſter-Attendant, or Clerk of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:47039:58"/>the Survey, (for they all ſign upon them reſpectively;) but that Boatſwains, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt give long attendance for Diſpatches, protracted for Lucre, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great Evils enſuing to the Affair there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: Yet the Commiſſioner is commonly to and again; and if he be ſharp ſighted, and willing to give hinſelf the trouble, will apply a ſeaſonable Spur, as well to them as all other ſlow Proceedings; which is a great branch of his Office, to quicken, ſpur, and enliven the whole Affair within his Juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Maſter-Attendant is an Officer of Buſineſs, and Truſt, for tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of Ships in and out of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, taking care for laying the Ships (all that enter the Port) at ſafe more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; that they damnifie not each other, do not break looſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to take care to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore, ungun, unrigg, and unballaſt them; and bring them to and from the Dock, and heave them into the Dock,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:47039:58"/>and out, provide Balaſt, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Rigging, Cables, Sails, Anchors, and Cordage for them; ſuitable and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable Stores for their Voyage: And on their Returns again to ſurvey the Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwain's remains, and take care for the laying them up for Preſervation; the Clerk of the Survey being the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor's Inſtrument, for Surveying the Stores of as well the Boatſwain's Stores, under the Maſter-Attendant his Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, as alſo the Carpenters Store's, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Maſter-Builder's Overſight, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their Accounts by the Vouches ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Builders, and Maſter-Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, of their Remains; and of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains their expence at Sea. The Maſter-Attendant alſo commands and directs the Labourers of the Yard; orders the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and making of Rigging at the Rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Houſe, appoints and directs the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; that is, the Boatſwain's Servants, and extraordinary Men, born on the Ships in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:47039:59"/>Harbour; and takes notice of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Perſons under his Command, of their either Neglect or Attending their Duty: All which he performs by his Subſtitutes, as by the Boatſwains of Ships for the Ordinary, and when he detaches Labourers to work on Float, to clear Ships, heave Balaſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And for the Labourers, the Boatſwain of the Yard, although warranted, works them; yet ſubordinate to the Maſter-Attendant: The ſaid Yard-Boatſwain alſo directs the Teams of draught Horſes, for drawing of Timber, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and heaving it out of Veſſels by Labourers; alſo all manner of Stores received in, and cleaning of the Docks and Yards, providing of Shovels, Pickaxes, Hand-ſpikes, Ropes, Blocks, and all Inſtruments to doe the ſaid work, and for heaving in and out Ships at the Docks. The Maſter-Attendant alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points Pilots for carrying Ships in and out of the Harbour, and ſigns their Bills
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47039:59"/>for it; as alſo the Huyes and Lighters, hired for carrying of Balaſt. His buſineſs is of large Extent, and he ought to be a Man of good Knowledge, as of the Practice of the Navy, ſo of the Shoals and Tides of the Harbour; a Man of Care, Induſtry, Courage, Temperance, Juſtice, and Honeſty; and well encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged and ſupported in his Commands: So ought alſo the Checque, Builders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in their reſpective Stations, appointed by the Commiſſioner of the Place, and alſo of the Board: Whereas if he be void of Knowledge, great Damages will enſue to Ships, in their Tranſportations and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, he not being acquainted with the Shoals; and ſetting of Tides, and the lyings of Moreings in the Harbour: the elder Boatſwain indeed may be his Guide, who officiates under him; but they will be apt to be croſs, and think they are wronged of their Birthright, whoſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion I cannot condemn: Neither can I
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:47039:60"/>think it either juſt, expedient, or ſafe, to the King's Service; to put a ſtranger who never ſerved, nor knew the Practice of the <hi>Navy,</hi> over the heads of able Men, who have ſpent their whole days in the ſaid Service; and therefore I cannot forbear to ſay here, as I have elſe where ſaid in the Preferment and Encouragement of Clerks: For it is hard meaſure, that a Man ſhall be neglected, and put by Preferment, not for any Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, but that he hath not made Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt enough, or is not willing to down with his duſt; although he has ſerved his Life long, and is a Man of much Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and Merit; which ſort of Men, as I have elſewhere ſaid, are Modeſt, and backward to offer to buy (as I there called it) their Fetters.</p>
               <p>One thing I have forgotten to hint be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the which perhaps may not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly applyed here, it being an Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I have made in the <hi>Navy, viz.</hi> That
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:47039:60"/>it is the Opinion and Practcie of many, not the beſt Officers, that they will bid the higheſt rate for Advancement; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, that when attained they are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> Reſt,) but not of Promiſe to them; but was promiſed, perhaps, to more merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Men, but that their Money and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt came ſhort: yet of Reſt they are reſolved to make it; concluding, that their Profits being encreaſed, their Cares ſhould be abated: And therefore they do reſolve to live quiet and ſecure, and act that part that ſhall procure them that; and let the World go round, if their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy fail not, their ſleep ſhall be ſound; and let the inferiour be induſtrious and full of cares: But I think it is altogether unſuitable to the Mind of a good Man or Chriſtian, a good Officer, or Leige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to his King and Country; and alſo ſhould think, the higher his Office the more his Cares; not only in the ſight of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:47039:61"/>good Men, but required by God: For the Sword of Juſtice was never deſigned by him to be put into the hands of one who will ſheath it, and play the Truant: Wherefore I am well aſſured, that it would contribute to the Welfare and Promotion of the Glory and Strength of the Navy and Nation, and be moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Dictates of God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to let Juſtice be plentifully adminiſtred through the whole Series of the Affair; that the leaſt Member thereof may gather enough for the Expence of his Family, of that Heavenly Dew or Manna, which is the Emanations of Heaven upon Man; and he that hath Juſtice in him, hath (although but weakly) one of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Attributes of God. I will end this Paragraph with a Declamation againſt the Injuſtice of ſome years paſt; To diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the places of the biggeſt Ships, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to young uncapable Men, that never ſerved in the Affair; nor, I beleive, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:47039:61"/>will, when need requires it; but, like the Drones in the Bee-hive, live at home, and ſpend the Honey, and the publick Service ſerve only them: Nay, one Employment hath not been enough, but two or three of the beſt; I mean, of the middle Stations of the <hi>Navy;</hi> I ſay, two or more have been one Man's ſhare, and deſerving Men, of good and approved Abilities, and of long ſtanding and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, have been put by, or onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in their low and beginning Station; and by conſequence muſt veil to Children and Pupilsin Buſineſs, if they will have Bread.</p>
               <p>But I return to my Maſter-Attendant, who, if he be not a Man of Novel In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, and break the Practices of the Yards, and do not be put upon through his Weakneſs, and Ignorance of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and Right of Command, by any malevolent and turbulent Boatſwain, that acts under him; and who tells him,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47039:62"/>that it is not the Duty of the Ordinary to heave out the Proviſions left in the Ships; for they are not the King's, but the Purſer's; and ſo cauſe the Wheels to ſtand ſtill, and the Docks to ſtand void, as I have before hinted, and ſo damnifie the Service conſiderably, and alſo the Officer: I ſay, he ought alſo to have Courage, and ſtand on his Right of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Men out of Ships, to clear o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as the neceſſity of the Service re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, and the Commiſſioner of the place directs; although there be a Captain that denies his Men to do it, except they be paid for it; I ſay he ought to bid hard up to the poſitive Point, and there to leave it, and the Damages thereof, at the Captains or Commiſſioners Doors. So that you ſee, that the Vertue of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage muſt not be wanting; for if it be, he cannot perform the Service well. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Juſtice and Honeſty he ought to be well ſtockt with; otherwiſe he will be
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:47039:62"/>tempted to connive with the Boatſwain's Embezlements, and ſign over large Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences; and he may be tempted to ſign over large Balaft Bills: and again, he may abuſe and hinder many other good Officers in their Servants, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Uprightneſs to the King's Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and pour out his Favours upon his Creatures: I ſay, this Officer ought to be endued with very good Vertues, or elſe he may, inſtead of doing much Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the Affair, do very much Diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The Clerk of the Survey is an Officer preſented thereto by the Survey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, but warranted by the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> who keeps the Account of all Stores received into the Yard by the Storekeeper; ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys them at their Entrance, and is one that ſigns the Bills for them to the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi>-board. He ſurveys all Remains of Stores at the Returns of Ships from Sea; of Boatſwains, and Carpenters, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:47039:63"/>paſſes their Accompts: He ſigns Vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to Storekeepers for Sea Stores, with the Maſter-Attendant, and Builders, with whom, and the Storkeepers, his Buſineſs interferes very much; and his Affair or Duty being in a leſs compaſs, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the reach of much Diſquiet, or Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he may be the more happy, if he be a Man of that Temper to uſe it ſo: His buſineſs being retired, and within himſelf, his Temptations to Diſhoneſty are the more and more recluſe and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, having opportunities thereby to cauſe him to fall, and break his Truſt; and therefore had need be a Man endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with honeſt and juſt Principles: Alſo he ought to be of good knowledge in the Nature of Stores, and a ready Clerk for Accompts. Moſtly the Surveyor takes great care to preſent a fit and experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Clerk, otherwiſe it would diſtract his Office aloft; and commonly he preſents one that has ſerved before in ſome under
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:47039:63"/>Clerkſhip of the ſame Office; which is a ſort of Juſtice I wiſh were practiſed throughout the <hi>Navy:</hi> I am ſure he is the more ſafe and quiet in his buſineſs; and no doubt the better Diſpatches are made therein by People apt and known to the buſineſs; without Tricks, Projects or new Fangles for Lucre. I know no Office in the <hi>Navy</hi> of that Quantity, that tranſacts their Buſineſs with Diſpatch, with ſo little Notice or Perturbation, and are ſo very ſedate and quiet; undoubtedly the more happy themſelves, and thoſe that negotiate with them, and the Services of the King in that Affair go or at leaſt run, in the ſtreight Chanel, without Meanders and Turnings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The Rope-houſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Clerk and Maſter-Rope-maker are the Guides of that Affair, only the Maſter-Attendant ſometimes may inſpect or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome ſizes of Ropes and Cordage, Cabels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be made, as they are
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:47039:64"/>needed; and alſo ſometimes his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are neceſſary to detatch ſome of the Ordinary, or Labourers, to twiſt the great Cables. Indeed this Office is very diſtinct from interfering with any of the reſt of the Offices; only the Maſter-At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant may detatch ſome of their Hands, to help to heave a Ship in or out of the Dock, or the Maſter-Builder, on ſome emergencies; the nature of their Work being ſuch, that they do their work often by Task, and ſo commonly do their day's Work by two or three a Clock: The Clerk hereof has a fine, quiet Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and very ſeparate, if he be a good ſpirited Man, ſo to uſe it, and to be juſt towards the King and the Men; for he keeps the Prick and Checque over them, and makes the quarterly Books up for their pay, and the Clerk of the Checque meddles not with them.</p>
               <p>But there is an Affair dependant, or appendant rather; yet it is ſeparate: For
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:47039:64"/>there is a Rope-maker that makes up all the old and half worn Cables, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, opens the Strands and knits them, and makes them up into Cordage again; and it is called twice laid ſtuff, and ſerves for running Ropes, Port Ropes, Stage Ropes, and ſmall Cordage. At <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> it is prettily managed; the ſaid Ropemaker contracts for ſo much by the Hundred, and has Tarr allowed him; the Storekeeper delivers it to him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives it from him, and certifies his Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities; and the King's Rope-maker is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, in that particular Yard only, from having any Cogniſance therein; who is the moſt able Man to inſpect it, and overſee the Work, that it be done as it ought; and no more made, or certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to be made, than is needful; or that too much Tarr be not put into it: But it is there finely carried; ſo that there is more made thereof in that Yard in a Year, than is in all the Yards beſide put
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47039:65"/>together: It amounts to about four Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds, ſome Years, bare Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, which the Man doth himſelf, and two or three Servants, Boys, for the moſt part. I accuſe not, but it is worth Obſervation, which is all I have to ſay of the Rope-houſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eightly,</hi> All the other Offices, <hi>viz.</hi> Maſt-maker, Boat-builder, Joyner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are under the Builder's Orders: But the Clerk of the Checque, if he be a fit Man, will eſpie ſome Works doing in the Joi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery, Painters, and Carvers Offices, for the Beautifying of Mens Houſes with Cabinets, fine Utenſils of divers kinds, Coſtly, and more to the King; for what is done there, coſteth the King twice as much Time and Materials as it is worth. In this nature divers Offices are corrupted: I fall not on particulars, but great Summs may be ſpent that kind of way; for Work and Materials may ſerve to adorn Mens Houſes, or build them about the Town:
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:47039:65"/>Theſe things are too obvious, and may not, nay, muſt not be denied, and all by connivance; and yet at the ſame time Thrift pretended, and ſcruple to let a Warrant-Officer on board have a ſmall Lock for his Cabin, or Store-Room: I ſay, theſe all are under the Builder's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, but he is blinded, and cannot ſee it; but the Clerk of the Checque ought to viſit them, and checque them; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Labourers, that are employed by greedy and purloining Officers of the Yard, if they ſet them to work in their Gardens, do all the ſmall and great Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces about their Houſes, run abroad any where about Errands, and abſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at any rate, under the pretence of being an Officer's Man, or Boat-man; the King may looſe no ſmall matter Year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I ſay, if a Clerk of the Checque be not a Man every way well appointed to his Buſineſs.</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:47039:66"/>
               <p>And thus I will conclude with the Yards; that they are all warranted from the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> and are under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and definite Orders of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner of the Place: But the Carver, Painter, Smiths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I reckon not of the Yards, but are dependants; and therefore I will ſay a few things to them here; That is thus:</p>
               <p>That Carved Work on the Ships is come, with the Painting them, to be a good part of the Charge of the Ship, and is not of any intrinſick value, in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Proportion to the coſt, contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the good of the Service, or Strength of the Nation; but, on the contrary, ſerves to rot the Ships, entangle them when two Ships happen to come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and moſt dangerous of burning the Ships when Fire-Ships ſhall board them: For it is generally the Carved Work that takes Fire firſt, and it runs on it like Wild-Fire, by means of the Oyl of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:47039:66"/>the Paint; and many times the Carved Work is as rotten as Touch-wood, and will take fire even with a Wad, or Coal of a Cartridg, or Tobacco. You may moderately compute the charge of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and Painting, that is needleſs unto the Navy, at the twentieth part of the charge of the Hulls of the Ships of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy; which now may be thought conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, when the Navy is ſwollen to ſo great a bulk, and a certain neceſſity to have it greater: For our Neighbours put ſo fair for the Dominion of the Seas, that I doubt, before the Naval Force of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom will be ſettled in a General Peace, this Kingdom may happen to be put to many hard Tugs, to maintain their Right; and the Wealth of the Nation, together with the Bloud thereof, will be greatly exhauſted; and therefore for the ſaving the one from profuſe Expences, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Breeding and Maintaining the other, is of no ſmall conſideration at this
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:47039:67"/>time; and the more timely it be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, we may with the more facility effect our deſires. As for the former, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the unneceſſary charge thereof, by the thirty laſt Ships, by the Parliament's Order built, if the Money they gave for it (as I think) was ſix hundred thouſand Pounds, and the King ſpent two hundred thouſand more, in all eight hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds; (admit that that were the coſt;) I compute the Carving and Painting at the Fortieth part of the whole, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Hulls to be but the half of that coſt, which is Four hundred thouſand Pounds: Then the Carving and Painting is the Twentieth part thereof, which is Twenty thouſand Pounds profuſe Expences, out of Four hundred thouſand Pounds ſpent on Hulls; which Twenty thouſand Pounds might be ſaved, and with more ſafety and ſecurity to the Ships from Fire, and leſs rotting their Work.</p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:47039:67"/>
               <p>The Arguments againſt this Thrift are uſually the Splendor of the Navy, and the Diſcouragement of Arts. The Arguments being weak, the Confutation may be ſhort; which is thus: The true Splendor and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Navy lies in the good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, the Eaſineſs of the Expence to the Nation, and the Atchievement of great Actions, preſerving the Honour, Safety, and Wealth of the Nation; and not in Adorning of our Ships: And for the Arts of Painting and Carving, it is not worthy to be named, in compariſon with the Coſt of the Affair. The means of this Profuſeneſs hath been created by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Builders at the Navy Board, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one endeavouring to excel each other in the Beautifying their own Works, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to bring them and themſelves into the greater Eſteem; and that they might be ſo with the Commanders, they have not ſtay'd there, but endeavoured alſo to exceed each other in the contriving the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:47039:68"/>for them, to that degree, that the other Officers, and the Seamen, are pent up into too little and ſmall Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations and Conveniencies; and the Warlike Uſes and Intentions thereof neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and much impeded; the which I ſhall more plainly make appear, when I am come on Board.</p>
               <p>Yet before I leave the Yard, I muſt take leave of the Porter, who hath ſhut the Gate upon me; who is an Officer alſo, and warranted from the Admiralty: His Office is to open and ſhut the Gates, and either himſelf or helper to be always at his Poſt, to take notice of all that enter or go out thereof all the day time; and to ſee the Watch ſet, giving them ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions as he ſhall receive from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners: If he be a temperate, careful, and honeſt man, he may prevent much Evils, which otherwiſe will ſlide without notice; by giving the Commiſſioner, Checque, Builder, and all the other chief
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:47039:68"/>Officers, needfull notice, and true informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what they ſhall ſee, or they enquire after; and tell them I am gone on Board, and dare not lie a night with my Wife, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though come lately from Sea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ninthly,</hi> The Officers of the Ordinary are, a Purſer, a Boatſwain, a Gunner, a Carpenter, and a Cook, of each Ship; with Servants according as the Rate of the Ship will bear.</p>
               <p>The Boatſwain is ordered by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-Attendant to come where he has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a Jack to be hoiſted on the Enſign-Staff, and there to work the Servants and extraordinary Men, till about two a Clock, except the Emergencies be the greater; and after the Work to repair on Board their reſpective Ships, and to clean them as is needful:</p>
               <p>The Carpenter to go with his Servant to work on Float where the Maſter-Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or Aſſiſtant ſhall direct, in ſuch like order as the Boatſwain.</p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:47039:69"/>
               <p>The Purſer and Gunner, in their turns, look to the Ships all the Day time, and in the Night take their Watches in their turns, with either Boatſwain or Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter.</p>
               <p>The Purſer takes care for Victualing them every Month, from the Shoar, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Warrants ſigned by the Checque, and Maſter-Attendant, after every Monthly Muſter made by the Clerk of the Checque, in the preſence of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner; and takes notice of every ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence by Diſcharge, Death, or Runa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: And to the Checque grounds his Warrants for the enſuing Month's Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, which the Purſer, when effected, ſigns to the Victualler, and he provides them Beer, Firing, Candle, and Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, <hi>viz.</hi> Canns, Platters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and accounts with the Victualler for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and the neceſſary Money which is allowed, <hi>viz.</hi> One Shilling <hi>per</hi> Man, <hi>per</hi> Month.</p>

They are to ſerve as Eſpials, or Watches on Float, to take notice what Boats paſs, and to examine what they do abroad af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Watch is ſet; which is by a Gun Fired, about the Twilight, by the ſaid Captain directed for the overſight of the Watch in the Harbour: The ſaid Boat is to go about the Ships, and take notice if there be a Watch kept on Board, and one walking upon the Deck all Night; and where they find any Neglect, or any Diſorder, by keeping of Fire, or Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle light all the Night, or Drunkenneſs, to hale them; and, if not anſwered, to put on Board, and inform themſeves of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:47039:70"/>the Diſorder: They alſo are to ſee what Boats paſs untimely; if purloining of Stores, ſtealing of Cuſtomes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of all which Misbehaviours he is to acquaint the ſaid Captain, and he the Commiſſioner, if worth the taking notice of; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Commiſſioner viſits them in the Night for the ſame purpoſe; and oftner the Checque, to obſerve their Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
               <p>And here I call to remembrance, for ſome time ſince, the rigid and ſtrict Hands car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried over theſe poor People, by a colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Pretence of Vigilance in the King's Buſineſs, and exacted conſtant Duty from them, both by Day and Night, glorying in the act of catching any one on Shoar, to viſit his Family, and ſuſpending many, to their great Impoveriſhment to ſollicit their Reſtoration; contrary to every Officer's Inſtructions, as their Duty gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them from the <hi>Navy</hi> Board; of which I will ſay more, when I come to Sea. But
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:47039:70"/>I apprehend theſe Proceedings tended not to the Service of the King; for two Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers on Board in the Night, and one in the Day, is as much as can in any wiſe be needful, conſidering the Hardſhips Men are put to: But when come Home, and near their own Doors, from the Fatigue of the Seas and Wars; and not to be ſuffered to converſe with their Wives and Families, but even as an Adulterer ſteals to an Harlot; which Severities act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them, exceed the Inhumanity of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Task-maſters, being beſide and beyond the Officers Inſtructions ſigned by them, a prepoſterous Proceeding, where good Method and Order is required: But it ſerved the Trick of their Deſign, to put a Mask before their Superiours Eyes, when they came before them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them of the needful, made this their Cardinal Care, to exact a both need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, inhumane, and undue Duty; to the great Diſcomfort and Undoing of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:47039:71"/>poor, needy, but good Officers: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that many died with Grief and Colds, and divers lived miſerable with Sickneſs and Poverty; and ſometime an act of Grace was paſt: But all this, I reckon, ſprang from the ſame Root, as the Deſigns were practiſed for; one time fiercely to vex and diſturb the Diſſenters, and then to promulgate Liberty by Grace; and all the while to bring an <hi>Odium</hi> upon the Church: So this to unhinge and and diſorder the well ſetled Government and Tranquillity of the <hi>Navy;</hi> the which being disjointed, it would, nay, muſt have expected to have fallen into the Hands, and under the ſole Management of a few; who, beſide their Policy in twiſting Deſigns to enrich themſelves, knew as little of the true Government of the Affairs of the <hi>Navy,</hi> as they intended it ſhould ſerve for the Safety, Honour, and Welfare of the Nation. And ſo I will leave theſe miſerable, poor Officers,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:47039:71"/>wiſhing themſelves Dead, or ſome way delivered from their Captivity by a Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to Sea, where perhaps they might meet with a Diſcharge from all by Death, Life being become miſerable, and Death more deſirable to them; and ſo curſing their Fates to be bred up to an Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that hath, in their mature Years, failed to obtain for them, in a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degree, Suſtinance for themſelves and Families they have contracted about them; their fates falling ſo heavy upon them, by the Machinations and Devices of deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men, finding the Juncto ſuitable both in the Principals and the Adherents, to alter and miſgovern ſuch an Affair, and ruine them, together with the loſs of the Glory, Honour, and Safety of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to the Acquirement of Honour, and Riches to the deſigning Proſecutors, or rather Perſecutors.</p>

               <p>THE <hi>Commiſſioners for Victualling,</hi> is a new Office; heretofore it hath been managed by Contractors; as Mr. <hi>Crane</hi> in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt's time; but in the late time of Exile, it had divers Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractors;
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:47039:72"/>as, one or more at every Port, and divers aloft; which Practice I cannot blame: For that Affair being of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which does admit ſuch ſort of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, which is the only Support and Gain of the ſame, without it they could not do it at ſuch rates as they have contracted for; that is, by buying, and encouraging the Purſers to buy, of the Officers and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, their Salt Proviſions; (for any one may judge, that thoſe Proviſions are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wholſome nor toothſome;) becauſe the Captain and all the Officers and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners that have Money, and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, will, at every Port they come at, get ſome freſh Eatables, of Fleſh, Fiſh, or Garden Fruits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Purſer buying the Salt of them, and letting them have Money at all times to refreſh themſelves therewith; the which the Purſer does commonly do for all the Ship's Company, when he comes to a Port where the price of freſh Proviſions will bear it, having
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:47039:73"/>Money by him always for that purpoſe, and is a piece of very good Service; for it makes the Proviſions laſt out longer, that the Ships may keep the Seas longer; and alſo refreſhes the Men, who are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe made ſickly, and die for want of Change of Diet; having no Money a long while.</p>
               <p>And although the Commiſſioners for the King may ſlight it, yet the Contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors never looked upon it otherwiſe than as the profitableſt Plant in that Garden: Nay, it is many times a Profit to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, for his Encouragement; for without that, I think, it is in vain to expect Men ſhould take upon them to ſerve the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; and our Saviour himſelf ſaith, <hi>Men go not to War on their own coſt:</hi> And he that pretends to ſerve the Publick, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expectation of ſome (though ſmaller) Honour and Riches, at leaſt, I believe him not: Nay, a proſpect of a Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation anſwerable to his Hazard and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:47039:73"/>or, that it may provide him with Competency of Livelihood, even com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to thoſe of his Brethren, trained up with like Education, and diſpoſed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Law, Phyſick, Merchandize, Shop-keeping, Farming, or Manufactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at home, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet often, and very often, it proves nothing ſo; and moſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten their Brethren, that ſpend their Time and Tallent at home, have ſuch a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Encreaſement of their Wealth, that, after a term of years be paſt, they are out of the Danger of Impoveriſhment: Whereas their publick-ſerving Brother is, after the ſaid Term, even then as hard at Cringing and Creeping to his Superior, as ever, that he might continue or increaſe his Maintenance, for the Support of his Family he hath gotten; or elſe is diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the loſs of Friends, who are either dead before him, or put beſide the Cuſhion; and having fallen upon the Lot of bad Voyages; Miſchances, croſs, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:47039:74"/>ruining Circumſtances, which have left him both Moneyleſs, and Friendleſs, and full of Family, and Years, and ſo with Grief makes his <hi>Exit;</hi> and leaves his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed and protracted Accounts to the management of the Unmerciful and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſionate, who too commonly make a Prey of the Remains, if any be; and leave the Widow and Family as ignorant of the Proceedings, as without Subſtance; and rendring the Security for them within their Reach, to be ſhorn by them: I ſay, this is the fate of too many that of late years have ſerved the Publick in that Affair; their utter Ejection having been projected long ſince, and the Efforts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the bringing it about having gone on in a continued Progreſſion, ſeemingly, now to be ripe for its effecting: Having, I ſay, ſo altered the Methods and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of that Office, That there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in it but few Perſons truly qualified for it; for often thoſe who are put into
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:47039:74"/>it, are Recommended by thoſe whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns are for the Extirpation of them, or at leaſt to continue the Shadow thereof a while longer; yet it ſhall be only the Shadow, and not the Nature and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: But the Methods and Practice of the Office is ſo altered, and ſubjected to the Superior, that the Service hath nought but the Footſteps of that Office left; nor can Benefit or Safety thereby in any Meaſure be expected to the King, the Service, or the Men; but the Affair turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under a Monopolized and Deſpotical Power. But the contriving the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Victualling by Commiſſioners, being a Principal Wheel to turn about the chief Projection thereof, what relates to their Management and late Proceedings therein, I am now to proſecute. And,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Five Commiſſioners are made to carry on this Affair, with large Sallaries, and Allowances of Dwellings, and of what they think good for their Families in
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:47039:75"/>the Offices; it being at the King's Charge. Theſe Men, I ſay, are Grandated at a Board; to hear and receive all Contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors Propoſitions, and paſs their Bills for Payment on their Caſhier; inſpect the Proceedings of their ſeveral Offices; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them Warrants and Orders for their Proceedings. Now if theſe Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners be unskilled in this Affair, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Nature of the Fleſh, its Seaſons for buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; (for very much skill is required for the knowledge in the buying, not only for the quantity, but the quality; for the Cattel may be bought in the Market after great Drift, and Pineing, only to ſweep the Market, becauſe of lower Prices, when the loſs thereby will return ten-fold; beſide the diſappointment of the Service, and the deſtroying of the Lives and Healths of the Men; filling the Service full of Confuſion and Diſcontent, and extreamly weakening the Affair; and in fine, making it more chargeable to the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:47039:75"/>King; it having been a well-ordered and well-governed Affair, by the beſt Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement imaginable.) Now, I ſay, if the ſaid Principals have no Inſight nor Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Affair, nor in the laudable Cuſtoms of <hi>Maritime</hi> Proceedings in the <hi>Naval</hi> Affairs, (I mean the King's;) What may not the Officers under them put on them? What Methods ſhall hold them? Or, what Steadineſs can there be in their conſtant Proceedings, to be juſt to all that negotiate with them, and all the whole Affair to be at a certainty of good and wholſome Proviſions, provided at the beſt Seaſons, and at the beſt Rates? I ſay, How can this conſiſt with Reaſon, if it may be (not to ſay it muſt be) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Subs; and only for form have the Approbation of the Principals; eſpecially if the Subs ſhall be Novices too, and not Men qualified for buſineſs?</p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:47039:76"/>
               <p>I could ſay a very great deal more in this Affair; but the ſight thereof hath filled my Mind with ſo much matter of Diſcourſe, that I am confounded, like the Affair; and know not how to ſpeak to it, ſo as to take a view of each part: Into which Method, if I proceed, I ſhould be too tedious in this Work; which I meant but as an Eſſay, for a Trial, hoping ſome abler Pen will erect a Manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon my Cottage; and therefore I ſhall only add hereto, That when Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractors had it, they were forced to look ſharply to the Affair, and to employ able and knowing People; and to let nothing of any private Intereſt creep into the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair; and to be ſure to buy good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and to have them well preſerved: And if any Humorous Commanders refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or abuſed the ſame; then their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments gave a good account thereof, and the ſame was turned to the King's Damage; for if there were any other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:47039:76"/>in the Receipts, Returning, or Expending the ſame, than what was the Ancient Cuſtoms of the <hi>Navy,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Preſcriptions in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts; ſo that all things went on accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Ancient Methods of the <hi>Navy,</hi> and Cuſtoms in <hi>Maritime Affairs;</hi> and ſeldom was there found any great Defects in Proviſions, nor any diſorderly Returns, Refuſings, or Abuſes: If any were to their damage, they would be ſure to acquaint the <hi>Navy-Board</hi> for Redreſs, and cauſe the Offenders to be queſtioned; and that deterred them from offering it, knowing that it would not paſs without notice; and the Contractors alſo, knowing that if the Affair were not carefully and diligently managed, it would turn to their great Damages; and if the Fleets were diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, it would be their breach of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, and fall heavy upon them: For they could not make ſuch Intereſt as to have it expiated at an eaſie rate, nor with
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:47039:77"/>colourable Pretences; ſo that both they, and all their Friends engaged with them, and their whole Value, lay liable to the King for ſatisfaction; nor could any Sale of Eſtate, or Gift, made during the time they were Accomptants to the King, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it from the King's Seiſures: So that, I ſay, there muſt be no room for inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, careleſs, or negligent Inſtruments, by private Intereſt; nor for any Wrongs done to any of the King's Servants, nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating with them, without making Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. Therefore, that the ſo great Affair might be managed, that there might be computed the certain Coſts the King ſhall be at, for the Maintainance of his <hi>Maritime Strength,</hi> and not fall under the power of any Intereſt, to make it coſt more; and with ſurety and ſafety perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as by the Contractors is made appear to be, is a Condition moſt deſirable, and requiſite, for the <hi>Navy</hi> to be conſtituted and ſetled in.</p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:47039:77"/>
               <p>But if it does appear to the Wiſe and Knowing, That it would better anſwer the ends aforeſaid to be managed by the King's Commiſſioners; then to that end I will make a few ſteps that way, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, as in the Heads aforeſaid; That it does conſiſt of a <hi>Comptroller,</hi> a <hi>Surveyor,</hi> and a <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> all reſident at the <hi>Office;</hi> except an Emergency calls them to the Ports; to avoid which, there is needful to be an Out-rider, or Riding <hi>Surveyor,</hi> whoſe buſineſs ſhould be to viſit the <hi>Ports</hi> and <hi>Fleet,</hi> and to enliven and quicken the Affair, and ſpur all the remote Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the diligent and careful perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their Duties, in their reſpective Stations; and to mark all Errors, and to give account thereof to the Board for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs; That Proviſions be not damnified by toſſing them to and from Ships, and ſuffer great Damages, and Demurrages of the Veſſels, by leaving them unſpent, whiles they may be preſerved; and that
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:47039:78"/>the Inſtruments do not make ſlow and ſlack Diſpatches, under ſmall pretences for Lucre, and ſtudy chiefly their own Profits; or to damnifie any one that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiates with them, by undue and unpra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable Proceedings, and Delays of Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the which would bring a general Diſreputation on the Action, and cauſe it to be the more chargeable to the <hi>King;</hi> and is alſo extremely hurtful to the Affair. Wherefore,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The <hi>Clerk-Accomptant</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, Iſſues, and Returns, ſhould be a Man of great Abilities, Honeſty, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, rightly to ſtate all Matters to the Board, and to paſs all the Accompts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Approbation and Allowance of the <hi>Navy-Board;</hi> that they might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed into the <hi>Treaſurer</hi> of the <hi>Navy</hi> his Ledger, and exhibited to the <hi>Exchequer;</hi> ſo that Eſtimates might be made upon all Exigencies that may offer.</p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:47039:78"/>
               <p>The <hi>Clerk of the Actions of the Board,</hi> ought to be a good Clerk and Secretary, to diſpatch good Inſtructions and Repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, in proper Terms; and to preſerve all Precedents and Orders in good Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod for Review, when needful.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Clerk of the Cutting-houſe,</hi> ought to be ſworn to do his Office juſtly, and faithfully; as alſo to ſee that his <hi>Packers</hi> under him be Sworn, and do execute their Office truly and juſtly; to mark the Contents faithfully and right.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Clerk of the Cooperidge</hi> alſo to be Sworn to ſee the due Gages put on all Casks for Beer.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Salters under the Clerk of the Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-houſe his Inſpection,</hi> ought to do their Office carefully, and painfully; and the <hi>Boat-takers,</hi> and <hi>Wharfingers</hi> to be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to provide for the Tranſport of the Proviſions where ordered, and to give them quick Diſpatches; alſo to receive the Returns carefully, and to preſerve

                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The Agents and Store-keepers abroad ought to do all the ſame thing that is done at <hi>London;</hi> but by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Directions of the Commiſſioners at the General Office, for Victualling at <hi>London,</hi> the ſaid Agent buys Proviſions, contracting for the ſame to be ſerved in as the Seaſon offers, and as he hath Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections from the Commiſſioners, with whom he keeps a continual Correſpond, and without whom, or their Directions, he can do nothing of moment: He draws his Bills for Money on them, and receives Money from ſome Receivers of Taxes, as the Commiſſioners aloft can get Aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the Treaſurer of the <hi>Navy,</hi> and he from the Lords of the Treaſury, on parts of the Revenue: He indents with the Purſers, he ſuperinſpects the whole Affair of Victualling at that Port, if there be no Commiſſioner or Riding Surveyor at the place, which in all times of Action extraordinary there ſhould
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:47039:80"/>be; and whenſoever any one is there, then he ſuperſedes him. The ſaid Agent is a perſon placed in great Truſt; for he has the Overſight of all, even as a Commiſſioner aloft has; and indeed his Office imports all that theirs does, <hi>viz.</hi> For the prudent managing and quick di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatching; only it lies not at his door to take care that there be ſufficient Proviſions at the Port, or Monies to ſupply all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergencies; he is only to give the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners conſtant and timely Account, and to do and ſee put in Execution all the Commiſſioners Orders and Advices, that he from time to time ſhall receive from them: and not to give any Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances for Damages, or allow any thing of moment for Demurrages, Caſual Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, or Miſtakes, without adviſing them firſt, and receive ample Inſtructions from them for it. And, in fine, he is an Image or Deputy of the Commiſſioners; yet more properly a Husband; or, as the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:47039:80"/>name more properly ſignifies, an Agent to act or do; yet as a Subſtitute to, and put in by the ſaid Commiſſioners, unto whom he is only accountable, and no where or otherwiſe concerned, than as his either general Inſtructions, or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Orders direct him. His general In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions ought to preſcribe him his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods in general, for ſupplying of Ships wants; by what Vouchers or Warrants, he ſhould order Deliveries; whoſe Orders he muſt obey, without appealing to them for Advice, and whoſe not; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he hath not in his general In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, he ought to adviſe the Victual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Board therewith, and expect their Orders therein: He is of principal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the Port, I ſay, he being Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and in the abſence of a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſione, is to cauſe the whole Affair to move by his Dictates; and gives his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the Store-keeper, for iſſuing and receiving; and alſo for Deliveries to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:47039:81"/>Brewers, Bakers, and Coopers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And next under him is the Store-keeper, who is warranted by the Commiſſioners alſo, but Sub to the Agent: He receives and iſſues by the Dictates and Orders of him: He takes care for the Cutting, Salting, Packing, and Stowing of the ſaid Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and the Tranſporting them on Board the Ships; receiving them back as Returns; and taking care for Sifting, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>packing, Overhalling, and preſerving them; and ſhould give the Agent an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the condition and quantities of them, at all reaſonable demands. For Quantities the Agent ſhould be as well able to know as himſelf; for he ought not to receive or iſſue any thing, without his Orders; the which the Agent ought to enter, as Debtor and Creditor, to him; thereby he ſhould be able to give the Board a ſtate of the Quantities in a Poſt's time; but abſolute Qualities he cannot, without a Survey, but ſomething near he
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:47039:81"/>might, if it be duely done, and in good Method, as ſuch an Affair of Quantity requires: For that Affair, the whole Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> the Readineſs and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceableneſs thereof to the King, is of great moment in the buſineſs I am treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of; the which is no ſmall Affair to the Kingdom: I ſay, it is in the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, and may eaſily, by perſons that are ignorant of it, or were never brought up, or had any practice or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge therein, be brought to great Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, and be made extreme chargeable to the King: For Prudent Management is a great part of this Affair for Profit; and the beſt and ſureſt way to it, is to have Good Inſtruments therein, and not to put Pupils and Novices into ſuch Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, to ſerve Private Intereſts; that is, to make the Treaſure, nay, if not the Wealth and Strength of the Nation, be ſpent, or do truckle to, and ſerve the Intereſt of ſome particular Perſons in
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:47039:82"/>their Relatives and Parties. As I have elſewhere decried the Practice, ſo I do here alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> not to putby Men of approved Knowledge and Experience in the ſaid Buſineſs, and of long Service, and in the room put in Novices, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils, and every way unfit, on purpoſe to ſerve a Private Intereſt: It is but the worſt way of making the Publick main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them.</p>

               <p>For I remember Mr. <hi>Richard Beckford,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Burrows</hi> did vend chiefly to the <hi>Navy;</hi> but not to hinder any others to Iſſue. For Mr. <hi>Thomas Beckford,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Knight, Brother to the ſaid <hi>Richard</hi>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:47039:83"/>and others, but as his Stock, and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Purſers</hi> to Iſſue for him, did encreaſe, did vend, and did endeavour to under-ſell, and out-do each other; but as yet his Intereſt could not reach to Ingroſs it, until after ſome time, as he grew able, did procure a Warrant from the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> then <hi>Lord High Admiral,</hi> to have the ſole vending to the <hi>Navy;</hi> yet, under the fair Pretences of ſhewing Samples to the <hi>Navy-Board,</hi> and they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing Prices for the Particulars; which Prices were followed indeed, but the Qualities of the Goods were debaſed, as he thought good: There was alſo added to the fairneſs thereof, That when they were opened on Board, if the Commander did not think them reaſonable good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Prices, he ſhould abate the Prices, or ſtop the Iſſuing of them. Who could expect that a Captain ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to judge indifferently of ſuch Goods, or, that the <hi>Slop-ſeller</hi> ſhould ſtand
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:47039:83"/>to the Judgment of every Captains know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or juſtice towards his Concerns? But this effect it hath had, That if the <hi>Purſer</hi> have dared to ſet down any lower price, than what his Invoyces mentioned, he muſt pay it himſelf; and ſo he had like order to the <hi>Pay-maſter</hi> of the <hi>Navy,</hi> to be accountable to him for all the whole Defalkation of the Ships Books; ſo that if the <hi>Purſer</hi> took, or bought any Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any at better Prices, and more ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Seamens Wants, and ſet it off upon the Books, the <hi>Pay-maſter,</hi> and <hi>Slop-ſeller</hi> underſtanding each other, brought all, <hi>viz.</hi> Dead-mens Cloaths, ſold at the Maſt, or any one Furniſhing the Marriner in his Sickneſs and Wants, to the <hi>Slop-ſellers</hi> Credit; and out of his Hands it was not eaſily, nor wholly got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but at his Pleaſure: And thereby, all People willing to aſſiſt the Seaman in his Wants, upon the Credit of his Pay, were thereby Deterred, and the Sailer totally
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:47039:84"/>fruſtrated of any choiſe, or good Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket for his Money, but that called <hi>Hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>'s <hi>Choice, That or none:</hi> In all which care taken for the good of the Sailer, and to keep him healthy and well in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, ſeems to me to have a quite contrary Effect; and indeed is no other than a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to make one Man Rich, at the coſt of many Thouſands, and to the loſs of many Mens Lives and Healths; ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to the Impairing of the Service, for the truth of it is, That every Man that ſerves the King for Wages, hath a Right thereto, as good as any Man hath to receive Rent for a Houſe or Land, if he does his Duty, and to buy or ſell thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Engage the ſame for Payment; which Engagement ſhould be ſatisfied at the Payment of the Ship, or Tickets there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as the ſaid Engagements doth Import: and if more than one appears for the ſame Sum, no Preferrence to be allowed, but as their Dates, or other Valuation in
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:47039:84"/>Law requires; then would the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men never ſuffer ſuch wants, as both them and their Families have and doth ſuffer; their Wives and Children would be reaſonably ſupported in their Abſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and they ſupplied at the Commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Voyage, with Neceſſaries for their Preſervation in the Service, by ſome of the Ship, or Port where they ſhall frequent, when People know that their Payment is of ſome Certainty, and not to be turned off Diſgracefully to the Honeſty of the Sailer, who is apt enough to refuſe Payment, when his Wants are ſatisfied: And herein is the <hi>Commiſſioner of the Pay</hi> his Juſtice to be exerciſed, to prevent Evil Men from Cheating the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who Credit them, and bring a Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal upon the Service, which makes the hard-heartedneſs towards them in their Wants.</p>
               <p>Now I intimate, that the Debts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, during that Service, ſhould have
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:47039:85"/>preference before thoſe contracted before the Commencement of that Service: The <hi>Dutch</hi> uſe that Method, that a Sailer need never want Credit for to ſupply his Wants, <hi>viz.</hi> As the Sailer hath need, the Captain gives him a Bill for ſo much Money as his Needs, or of his Families are; which Bill he ſends home, where there are enough that will take that Bill at a ſmall Abatement: The juſt perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the ſame, gives ſuch Credit to it, that People will ſtrive who ſhould have it at the leaſt loſs, they being paid without Rebuke, or uncertain Payment; which hath been the Fate of the Affairs in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for many Years paſt, that a Ticket-Buyer is an Odium: And notwithſtanding moſt of the Tickets have been bought and ſold, and paſt to Account by Quantities, and done behind the Curtain; if a Man ſhould happen to be Diſcharged by a Ticket, and needs Money for his Equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for another Voyage, he is in a Wood,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:47039:85"/>and knows not which way to bring that into Money, nor have any Friend that is willing to ſupply him, and ſend him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout another Voyage, nor any Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to do it, leſt he does undergo the Guilt of a Ticket-buyer, which have been accounted as Cheats; ſo that if he does, he may loſe his Money, or elſe he muſt find out the way behind the Curtain, as others do, where is moſt cruel loſs, it going through ſo many Hands to the Mark. I ſay, for many Years paſt, this Practiſe hath been, That like <hi>Woodſtock-Bower,</hi> or the <hi>Inchanted-Caſtle,</hi> except he had that Clew of Thread, <hi>viz.</hi> found the Myſtery he ſhould never attain the end, except the Perſon himſelf did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; yet ſo he muſt find out the Knot and untie it, after he had worn out his Patience by Delays, and ſcornful Anſwers; but two to one, e're that he had worn out both his Patience and his Cloaths, and had found the way behind the Curtain, and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:47039:86"/>taken ſome Money for it, but not enough to pay his Creditors, nor relieve his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, but Packt away on another Voyage, thin Cloathed, and Pennyleſs; curſing the Service, but whom he cannot tell: I ſay, this hath been the Fate of the Sailer for many Years together, yet freſh enough to Memory; and ſtill the King ſaves not a Penny, but pays every Groat on't, and perhaps Intereſt, to raiſe the ſaid Money for it: Nay, a Stranger would think in himſelf, if he ſtood but by to hear the Anſwers to Queſtions about the good or bad payment, or where-ever it would be paid, that the Parties Intruſted in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair did give the greateſt Diſreputation to it, whoſe duty it was, to have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and ſupported the King's Credit with the <hi>Maratime</hi> People, which is of more value than all the Merchants Credits in <hi>England;</hi> for their Welfare, and the whole Nations depends upon the Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>Navy:</hi> For if we ever be brought
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:47039:86"/>to truckle under the <hi>French</hi> at Sea, as I doubt, hath been fairly endeavoured for; farewel the Honour and Felicity of this Nation; but perhaps the Actors therein would have made themſelves great there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, according to their Deſires: What a dreadful caſe is it that ever a Man ſhould ſet his Hand to the utter ruine of his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with the Religion, Laws, and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof; and to ſettle that upon his Poſterity, <hi>viz.</hi> a little Pelf; and knows not but that, as another <hi>Pharoah,</hi> who knew not <hi>Joſeph,</hi> would make them all Bondmen. I fear there is remaining upon Poſterity too many Honours and Eſtates of Perſons, Gaining them by the daring to adventure the breach of the Laws of God and their Nation: For never did a Nation undergo any great Alteration, whether for the better, or for the worſe, but Honours are created thereupon: Wherefore it would be as neceſſary, as upon the Entrance of any King upon the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:47039:87"/>Throne, to paſs an Act of Indempnity; ſo alſo to paſs an Act for the Confirming of Honours, wherein every Honour by Patent, ſhould be Named: Or, if it be a ſhorter way to be excepted, that have raiſed it, or uſed his Anceſtors Honour, to the breach of the Laws eſtabliſhed; ſo that none ſhould paſs, but what ſtood the Scrutiny; which would be a means to deter Men from getting Honours ſo ill, or preſerve their Anceſtors at ſo baſe a rate: Knowing that if he ſuffer in one King's Reign, his Poſterity will ſurely be righted in another, if ever the Nation comes to it ſelf again. However, the true Object of a Juſt and Honeſt Man, is to fear God, do what is Juſt, and to wait upon him for the Iſſue of his Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>Having followed the purſuit hereof, and digreſſed, I will return to my <hi>Slop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller;</hi> and therefore ſay, That the Sailers Market, inſtead of Reſtraint, ſhould be
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:47039:87"/>promoted, and People Invited to come on Board by their Civil Treatment; and to truſt the Sailer with their Goods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoar, when they are Bargained for; by endeavouring all that are concerned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that they be duly paid for, with the leaſt Trouble or Defalkation to them; and to uſe all the art to promote his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Credit in the Affair, not only with his <hi>Maratime,</hi> but with all his Subjects: For Credit and Honour are too near of Kin to be made Oppoſites, as for ſome time it hath been. Nay, it would anſwer to that great end of Profit to the Service, by taking off the growing charge, <hi>viz.</hi> if Money be not ready to pay the Ships, they might have Tickets, which would be bought up by Monied Men at little loſs to the Sailer, and expedite the Affair; there being Money enough in Money'd-Mens Hands, who would be glad there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, if they were Encouraged and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced therein: The contrary Practice
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:47039:88"/>I underſtand not. I ſay, let any Man ſell his Ticket openly upon the <hi>Exchange,</hi> Street, or Shops, and countenanced through the Nation, and reckon'd a good piece of Service to lay out much Money in them; but that which added greatly to the Sailers Damages before, being now removed, <hi>viz.</hi> Buying of Tickets ſhould not be declaimed, and yet ſold behind the Curtain, by only thoſe who have pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Correſpondence; but that it ſhould be free, and declared a Commendable Service: I ſay, theſe Indirect Policies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing removed, the Sailer would be in mighty Credit, and the whole Affair would go on with Life and Vigour; any thing to the contrary I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>
               <p>I confeſs, I ſhould add hereto the uſual Objections, to back their Practices afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid; (and they are,) That the Sailer is Cheated; and again, he ſpends his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in Drink, and is kept on Shoar from
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:47039:88"/>the Service thereby: the which is all meer Sham, and only a mudding the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to catch Fiſh. For to pretend to keep a Man's Money from him, to make him a good Husband, and that he be not Robbed on't; and in the mean time to leave a way open for him to be Cheated cleanlily of a fifth, fourth, or third part on't, as he can eſcape their hands, or to fall under a <hi>Poſt-pone;</hi> the which the Cunning Dealers do foreſee, and find Preferrence to avoid; but from ever <hi>Poſt-poning</hi> the <hi>Naval</hi> Debts of this Nation, <hi>Good Lord Deliver the King and Parliament:</hi> But inſtead, to ſtrengthen the Publick Credit of the <hi>King</hi> with the <hi>Navy,</hi> by an Act, That whoſoever ſhould buy the Bills for Stores, Tickets, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benters for Wages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould receive their Money without any Defalcation made therefrom, ſave what was Written fairly to their view upon it, before they bought it; and that in its due Courſe,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:47039:89"/>out any Preferrence, as they are entered in the Office for Aſſignments; and that the Publick Credit being paſt therein, that Officer that ſhould make any Preferrences in Aſſignment or Pay, ſhould be Diſcard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or ſuch Penalties be inflicted as may be thought fit; and whoſoever in any Office, that ſhould ſpeak ſlightly to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage the Payment, and undervalue the Affair, ſhould be treated in like Terms as a Merchant, or Shop-keeper, Lord, or Gentleman, would Treat his Servant that does, when any one comes to him for a Debt due from his Maſter, anſwer him Surlily, and Contemptibly, and Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, whether ever it would be paid: Such Servants, I confeſs, I have heard, have been in ſome Families; But what were they? Such as ranked not Honour and Credit together, and let all run at Hurles; and was Precipitating to an end of Honour, Credit, and Eſtate. I judge the Affair I am treating of, will aptly
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:47039:89"/>enough fit the Compariſon; and therefore I will conclude with the <hi>Slopſeller,</hi> That if the Affair were carried as aforeſaid, there will need no <hi>Slop-ſeller,</hi> but ſuch as ſhall ſtrive to underſel each other, and truſt to the <hi>Purſer</hi> for vending of them, or any one elſe, and produce their Bill for them to be ſtopt out of their Pay, and paid at the Pay of the Men; or, that the <hi>Pay-master</hi> do anſwer the Draughts of the <hi>Purſer;</hi> as for Dead-mens Cloaths, Tobacco, Neceſſaries, or Money for the ſupply of themſelves and Families; and the <hi>Purſer</hi> to make good his Draughts, and account with the <hi>Pay-maſter</hi> for the whole Defalcations on the Ships Books; the which he ought to make good and ſtand to; for why the <hi>Slop-ſeller,</hi> or the <hi>Pay-maſter</hi> ſhould have the Ballances, no reaſon is to be given. More might be ſaid, but I ſpare.</p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:47039:90"/>
               <p>This was the Ancient Cuſtom of the <hi>Navy</hi> before Corruption, Bribery, and private Intereſt came into the Affair; and Tricks, and Deſigns of Expoſing the Honour and Safety of the Nation to the Power and Will of ſome, none of the beſt Meaning: Since which Deſigns began, things have run on with a ſwift Innundation, overflowing the Banks of Method, Diſcipline, and Government; ſo now hoping that the ſource is ſtopt, and that the breaches will be made up again, and the right Courſes well clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſcoured, and ſo kept in the right Channel; to which purpoſe I will la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour yet to bring more Materials, and conclude this Paragraph with Advice to the <hi>Slop-ſeller;</hi> That if he will ſell as cheap as any others, and take the <hi>Purſer</hi>'s Bills, and Ballance his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt with him, and not crave Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt-Money of the <hi>Navy-Board,</hi> to pay him in part before-hand; then I
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:47039:90"/>believe he may ſell a great deal of Cloaths, and be a Gainer enough, but not enough to underſtand the <hi>Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter,</hi> and Friends aſſiſting; and to keep Coaches, and live like a Peer too; which I think he will not condeſcend unto; and therefore I take leave of him, and deſire no more of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in this Affair.</p>

               <p>If a Prince ſends an Embaſſy to his Neighbour Prince, for the ſetling a good Correſpondence, of Balance in Trade, or Aſſiſtance in Needs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, to cauſe the Prince he comes to to believe, that what he ſays, and conditions with him for, will certainly be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and therefore extols, and ſets forth
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:47039:92"/>his Maſter's Juſtice, his great Strength, his Kindneſs for him, <hi>viz.</hi> his Ability, Juſtice, Truth, and Willingneſs to ſerve him, in very laudable Terms; and by a Perſon, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Ambaſſador,) who muſt be a Man of good Aſpect, and of good En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, as may be had in one Man; nay, and his Retinue alſo; that they may be a Grace and Honour to their Maſter, Nation, and the Buſineſs they come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; but if not, the effect will be clean contrary: And ſo of the Sea-Chaplains, who if they are of bad Lives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the better their preaching and Praying is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, the farther they Preach the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of conceit with their Religion; but if a Sot and Dunce, doing his Office like himſelf, and living ill, they are the leſs offended at it, and conjecture that the reaſon the Affair being ſo ill preſented and ſet forth to them, is not the fault of the Meſſage, or the goodneſs of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but its Fate to fall into the hands of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:47039:92"/>a Slovenly, Sottiſh, and a Dunce of a Prieſt; but if an Ingenious Man, though Debauch'd, Vitious, and a Coward, comes to them, it makes them to queſtion their Religion they profeſs; and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſtrict Lives of the <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi> abroad, the Macerating Faſtings, and in fine, their <hi>Pompous Shows</hi> fairly ſet forth, of a True and Sincere Faith, and a good Church-Diſcipline, and compare it with Ours, would be ready prepared, and apt, when the Iron came to be hot, (as it was heating apace) to declare, That their Religion had been all along in the wrong, and that now they would, if demanded, imbrace the right; they thinking, by their bare Speculations to have judged aright. Wherefore there ought to be great care taken, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is ſent on theſe Miſſions, ſhould be Man of Excellent Lives and Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:47039:93"/>
               <p>Now if it ſhould be ſaid, none would go then in the Fourth Rates, becauſe of ſmall Companies of Men for their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits; and few good Men could be gotten to adventure in the other, but ſuch as by their Inſufficiency, or Unfitneſs, have miſſed their Preferments on Shoar. To this I Anſwer, that either the Viſitor of the College, or Head of the Univerſity, have not power or will to detach able Miſſionaries for the Sea, and to gratifie their Labours with Preferment at their Returns, or there is a Miſcarriage in the doing it; for it is better none were ſent, than ſuch as I deſcribed; and let the Groats go towards the maintainance of the Sick and Wounded Seamen, from whom it is ſtopt, as it is now ordered in caſe of no Chaplain, of which more hereafter.</p>
               <p>But in caſe of ſending Chaplains, there ſhould be Dean Rurals appointed. <hi>viz.</hi> to Correſpond with the Suffragan, or he
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:47039:93"/>that chuſes out theſe Miſſionaries, and ſends them to let them know of the <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanors</hi> of every one; the ſaid <hi>Dean</hi> to be on Board of every <hi>Flag,</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander</hi> of every <hi>Squadron,</hi> every Ship's Boats-Commander, and Officers fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting there, he may enquire if any Miſdemeanors be; that perhaps a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,</hi> or <hi>Admonition</hi> in the Spirit of <hi>Love</hi> may do; or elſe give account to the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragan, who ſhould ſend for him away quietly, and ſend another in his <hi>room;</hi> and not let him abide there Preaching backwards, till either the Captain does diſgracefully turn him aſide, or bring him to a <hi>Council of War,</hi> and ſo diſcard him.</p>
               <p>Now I being come to the Paragraph, <hi>of the Government of the Ships at Sea,</hi> this relating to the ſame, I thought it <hi>worthy</hi> to have a diſtinct <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> prelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>others;</hi> and having before told you of an evil <hi>Root,</hi> that bears evil
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:47039:94"/>
                  <hi>Fruit</hi> in the <hi>Navy;</hi> alſo thence ſprang this Branch for the <hi>Commander</hi> to put what <hi>Chaplain</hi> he pleaſed into the Ship; ſo that if the Chaplain pleaſed not him, he was not to be admitted, or continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And therefore, as I was ſaying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, That they had need to have <hi>good Courage</hi> to oppoſe the not to be pleaſed <hi>Commander,</hi> without he ſubmits either to Cajole him in his Irreligious, Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and Atheiſtical Expreſſions; and all others of the ſame Temper, who muſt all be his Imitators; or elſe he muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to be turn'd off, and ſeek for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But this was not heretofore ſo, for whom the Suffragan did ſend was to be the Man: Indeed if a Captain deſired any one that he knew, and the Suffragan had not ought againſt him, he was gratified with him; but no Chaplain ſhould be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rejected by the Captain on his own Knowledge, or from the Splenetick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of another, without being
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:47039:94"/>led to a <hi>Council of War,</hi> if he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any Crime that came within the Articles of War, or before the <hi>Admiral, or Commander in Chief,</hi> for leſs Offences: Where the <hi>Dean-Rural</hi> is, who ſhould exert his Care over him, to defend his Innocent and Harmleſs Behaviour? and not ſuffer him to fall under his <hi>Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's</hi> Diſpleaſure, and be diſgraced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, if Innocence and Inoffence be found in him; and that he be not ſubjected to the ſole Will of the <hi>Commander,</hi> and therefore forced to ſubmit to baſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maenor, both to the <hi>diſhonour</hi> of himſelf, and him that ſent him: For the Baſis of the Deſign was ſo laid, whereof I ſpoke before, That making the Captain Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and Deſpotical, they let him break a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder all Laws, Privileges, Methods, or Preſcriptions at pleaſure, and let all Superiour Officers act conſonant thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. So that in making ſure of them, <hi>viz.</hi> the Captains, that they would come over
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:47039:95"/>at a Whiſtle, their great deſign would take effect: But no Humane Policies were ever laid ſo ſure, but that there were Ifs, Ands, and Doubts in it; and never was a Town or Fort made by the Art of Man ſo ſtrong, but under God's permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by the Art of Man was found out a place, or means to make it Pregnable; ſo have theſe Deſigners (God be praiſed) been diſappointed, before they could fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh their Work upon this Baſis, and like <hi>Confuſed Babel</hi>'s work, made an abrupt ſtop, and ſo ſtand ſtill: I have not read that any means was uſed to deſtroy their Foundation, begun at <hi>Babel;</hi> that none other like attempt might be made upon the ſame Baſis; but as the Scripture ſays, <hi>They were all diſperſed, ſome one way and ſome another, and divided;</hi> that therefore there may be thought no need to make any Proviſion againſt a ſecond attempt in that kind, and on that Baſis; as was at the turning our Firſt Parents out of <hi>Paradice,</hi>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:47039:95"/>and ſetting Flaming Swords to defend it from any more entrance; but in this caſe it is not as it was with the <hi>Babel Builders;</hi> but the Baſis ſtands in a great part, and the Builders alſo; but the <hi>Motions</hi> are ſlow, yet the <hi>Machin</hi> being entire, and ſo only watches for the moving of the Waters to turn the Wheels which way ſoever a Few will direct it: This being a <hi>Preludim.</hi>

                  <hi>VII.</hi> Of the Government of Ships at Sea.</head>
               <p>FIRST the Captains and Lieutenants are to be conſidered: The Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant being the Image of the Captain, and the Executor of his Command; I conclude them under the Captain's Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, he being the Head and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of the Ship, and may be fitly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to an Emblem of <hi>Monarchy;</hi> which, with <hi>Moderate Bounds</hi> and <hi>Conſtitutions,</hi> is the beſt of <hi>Governments</hi> ever yet found out in the <hi>World;</hi> and therefore moſt to be deſired and maintained. The Captain, I ſay, is the <hi>Ruler</hi> and <hi>Governour</hi> of the Ship and Men, in all Matters, both Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary and Civil; nay, and Eccleſiaſtical <hi>too;</hi> he orders and diſpoſes of the Ship, and its <hi>Military Proviſions</hi> and <hi>Stores,</hi> and prepares her, and fits her for <hi>Military
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:47039:96"/>Execution,</hi> either for Defence, or Offence, as he ſees <hi>occaſion;</hi> and for the doing it, he hath of all ſorts, of both <hi>Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> and <hi>Warranted</hi> Officers, Temporary and Standing Officers, appointed from the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> and <hi>Navy-Board, &amp;c.</hi> to act in their ſeveral Stations and Truſts; and they all having, or ought to have, as well as himſelf, Ample Inſtructions, to act in their particular Places and Truſts; the which if they <hi>follow,</hi> they ought to be protected in Safety, as well by him, from any Injuries offered them, or their Charges by any others, as alſo encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in their Duties; ſo alſo by the <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty</hi> and <hi>Navy-boards,</hi> from any Injuries offered them by him, or ſuffered by his Connivance.</p>
               <p>Now as to <hi>Inſtructions,</hi> I having ſaid ſomething thereof elſewhere before in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, I ſhall here ſpeak more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and that is, That although the <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Preſcriptions</hi> for the <hi>Captains Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:47039:97"/>hath been ſo enlarged and altered of late, in every Circumſtance relating to the Standing Officers, unto whom are committed all the <hi>Stores</hi> of the Ship, that there is ſcarce any ſign of the former Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice remaining, the Particulars being <hi>too</hi> many for me here to ſpeak to: Yet I ſay, the ſtanding Officers their <hi>Inſtructions</hi> are the ſame which have been near theſe Thirty Years ſtanding, to my knowledge, and not one Tittle of them is of uſe, or practice, or have been expected from them ſome Years paſt, ſaving the paſſing their Accounts, and making their Returns; the which <hi>Inſtructions,</hi> if they ſhould ſtand to, and abide by, they would be ruined: Neither have the Captains, and Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and the Warrant Officers <hi>Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> any <hi>Concordance</hi> or <hi>Coherence</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but the Practice hath been to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the <hi>Commander's</hi> Pleaſure, and if he be not Angry all is well; the which is a very hard matter to pleaſe, except they
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:47039:97"/>will be content to go to Sea for <hi>nought,</hi> and truckle under his Creatures: I ſay, this is the caſe in general, now grown to that height of Pride and <hi>Imperial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> that an Officer that cannot ſcrew himſelf into his Favour, were as good be a Slave in <hi>Algiers,</hi> for he muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go all Hardſhips and Indignities that all wicked-minded Men can put upon, or deviſe againſt him; and, as I may ſay, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himſelf to be Piſt upon by every <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior,</hi> that the Captain will either <hi>favour</hi> or <hi>connive</hi> at; this is ſo true and <hi>common</hi> to the knowledge of all that know the <hi>Navy,</hi> that it may paſs without farther <hi>proof:</hi> So that if any one ſhould not be tempered for this uſage, but be ſo hardy as to vindicate his Right, he is certainly ruin'd, and turned to ſeek his Bread elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, perhaps in his Latter Days; and muſt not expect to be heard in his own Defence.</p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:47039:98"/>
               <p>I confeſs, there is no <hi>General,</hi> for ſo I ſpeak, but does admit of <hi>particular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions;</hi> that is, there are ſome <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Men</hi> in their Commands, but <hi>too</hi> too few, and they not fully arrived to the deſign, which is yet more, <hi>viz.</hi> to have the Office of the <hi>Purſer</hi> annexed to the <hi>Captain,</hi> then were they as Abſolute and Deſpotical as the King of <hi>France</hi> is, and of late hath proved to be, over his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and he no doubt did concurr in the deſign of Contracting the <hi>Navy of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> under the Deſpotical Power of a Few, for the purpoſe, rather than many: To which, I ſay, and no other, tended theſe <hi>diſcordant</hi> and <hi>incohering Circumſtances,</hi> which cauſed Jarrings, Diſheartnings, and thence the Murmurings and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainings in our Ships, and the <hi>Navy</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly weakened. And as to the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Welfare of the <hi>Navy,</hi> for the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualling to be depoſited into the hands of the <hi>Captain,</hi> What may be the Effects
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:47039:98"/>thereof, I cannot ſo well ſpeak to, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not yet agreed how to order it: Some project, after the <hi>Dutch</hi> Example; Others, for the <hi>King</hi> to Victual, and the <hi>Captain</hi> to act by an Inſtrument under him; And a third, a mixt way. As to the <hi>Dutch</hi> way, the <hi>Captains</hi> agree with their <hi>Admiralties,</hi> at a certain price, for ſo many Mens Victuals, for ſuch a Ship un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Commands, and the Particulars thereof are ſpecified; and a <hi>Scrivan</hi> or <hi>Muster-Maſter</hi> of every Ship is ſent, beſide a <hi>General Muſter-Maſter</hi> in every <hi>Fleet,</hi> to keep Checque, and Muſter all the Fectives, noting all the Dead, and Runaways; and by his Book the <hi>Captain</hi> is paid for Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and the Bills are paid which he draws home, <hi>viz.</hi> for Wages to Men: He pays, when abroad, according to Inſtructions; of all which, the <hi>Scrivan</hi> keeps due ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with him. Now the Victualling of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> is chiefly <hi>Groat</hi> or <hi>Oatmeal, Grey-peaſe, Stockfiſh, Butter,</hi> and <hi>Cheeſe,</hi> &amp;c. and a little <hi>Fleſh</hi> once a Week:
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:47039:99"/>Now they have not Fleſh in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to do as we do; therefore, if the <hi>King</hi> will alter the Quantity and Specie of his Victualling, he may; but it will not agree to the Temper of his Subjects, but cauſe a great murmuring; <hi>Firſt,</hi> By his Sea-men: And <hi>Secondly,</hi> By the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, Gentry, and Nobility of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Product of their Lands be not bought off and expended, with the Money they are taxed to maintain the War with; and urge, That the Strength of the <hi>Navy</hi> would be impaired and weakened thereby, and be the cauſe of an Univerſal Diſquiet. And next, the <hi>King</hi> muſt put in <hi>Captains</hi> ſtockt with Moneys, or Security for the performance of their Duty, elſe the Ships would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be in readineſs to Sail, for want of Proviſions to act together; the Money elſe would be ſpent that ſhould buy them, and few would truſt them, and the Men would be abuſed with wants, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:47039:99"/>nay, dare not complain. It may be ſaid, Why with us, more than the <hi>Dutch?</hi> I Anſwer, The <hi>Dutch</hi> are a different People by Nature, and different in their Government, which is partly <hi>Democraſie,</hi> and partly <hi>Ariſtocraſie;</hi> they are ſevere Juſticiaries, and ſtrict Performers of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts to the Publick; in which, from one degree of Office to another, they are all ſharply lookt to, and therein are not peſtered with ſo many Methods, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to avoid wrong, whereas 'tis only a Miſt caſt before our Eyes, and proves a burden to the Publick, and has contrary effects to the intention, and makes the Proverb true, <hi>That the more Cooks, the worſe Broth:</hi> For the <hi>Dutch,</hi> if any ſhould be caught Cheating or Abuſing the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, he muſt run his Country, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hope to eſcape great Puniſhment, with Confiſcation of all he has; for ſuch is the Hatred of them all, to thoſe that hurt the Publick, for every one
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:47039:100"/>reckons himſelf a Sharer in the Publick Wrongs, that if his Wrong hath taken wind, and it be conſiderable, two to one but before he can withdraw, the <hi>Mobile</hi> will cut him off, and none dares to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance his Eſcape, for fear of the <hi>Mobile: Remember the</hi> De Wits; for if ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe exhauſting of Treaſure, and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>application from the true Intentions, and Plots againſt the Publick, had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted there, as have been here, they would not have Eſcaped; but if the <hi>Publick Juſticiaries</hi> had not done Juſtice, the <hi>Mobile</hi> would have Carved it out themſelves: So I ſay, their Conſtitution is far different from ours, for Intereſt runs not ſo high there: Now would they who labour for this Alteration in the <hi>Navy,</hi> alſo bring the Nation under ſuch a Government as they are, then they may expect it ſhould anſwer the end as theirs does: But it is not better than ours, nor half ſo well, if our Conſtitutions had
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:47039:100"/>been preſerved, and Private Intereſt caſt out, and Commands carried ſo Moderate and Juſt as theirs; but it is plain and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to me, that this Practice and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour is only the Baſis of the Work, or Deſign on foot, which I e're while com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared unto <hi>Babel;</hi> and a Superſtructure to be thereon built, to have the <hi>Navy</hi> in a few hands, who would be Abſolute and Deſpotical therein: And if they do deſign to have the <hi>Navy</hi> after the <hi>Dutch</hi> Government, if they would have it thrive in like manner as they do, they muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to alter the Government of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> as theirs is, or elſe it will never frame as theirs, for the Reaſons I have before mentioned; but I think it is paſt their skill yet. I could add many more Reaſons, but it is needleſs; and therefore I would have them put out of hopes of ever Ingroſſing or Enſlaving the <hi>Navy of England</hi> under a Deſpotical power, and conſequently of turning the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:47039:101"/>Government of the Nation upon Hinges which have but few Joynts; the which is very dangerous in a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> but not ſo in a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> who by their long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued and beloved Conſtitutions, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been accuſtomed by Allarms of being Robbed of their Liberties, will, on any Allarm, as a Flight of <hi>Sterlings,</hi> caſt themſelves into an orderly Flock, when they eſpy a <hi>Hawk</hi> at hand; but in a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi> it is altogether unſafe to put their ſtrength at the Devotion of a few hands: Moreover, it is againſt all <hi>Maxims</hi> in Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to make any Alterations in a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetled and approved Method of Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a material part of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Strength, and Wealth of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>This Project was on foot in King <hi>Charles the Second</hi>'s Time; who Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>And Captain, When your Men ſuffer, unto whom ſhould Men complain? To your ſelf, for Juſtice?</hi> He ſaid, <hi>He would be
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:47039:101"/>Juſt.</hi> The King ſaid, <hi>He had a good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his Captains,</hi> but laughed at the Project; and ſo it died for that time. And as for thoſe who would have them Victualled by the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>Captain</hi> account with him for it, inſtead of the <hi>Purſer,</hi> they are thus Anſwered, <hi>That their Projection is yet more open for Deſpotical Power, for then it will be brought to a far heavier burthen for the Nation, by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners Providing, and the Captains Commanding, who will have the King's Purſe open at their pleaſures, and every one muſt bow to them for a piece of Bread; and what Rule an</hi> Admiralty <hi>will have over them, to keep them to Methods and Preſcriptions, or a</hi> Navy-Board, <hi>is pretty well ſeen by a handful out of a full Sack aforeſaid;</hi> and therefore thoſe that are for this way, are more beſide the Mark; for here they have a means to make it a greater uncertainty of Charges, and have a greater influence on the Affair, and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:47039:102"/>create Neceſſities at their Pleaſure, and will account at their Leiſure. And as for thoſe that are for a mixt way, when they have formed and declared their Method, I may be able to give them a full Anſwer, and in the mean time I will only purſue my Purpoſe, to unravel the Proceedings of late, in the Confuſed Methods left ſtanding of the <hi>Babel-Builders;</hi> and that is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is created a <hi>Captains Clerk,</hi> for the Captains Muſtering, Ticketting, and ordering as well of the <hi>Purſer</hi>'s Books, as of all the Expences of the other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, who has a <hi>Midſhipman</hi>'s Pay for his Service, and double <hi>Midſhipmens</hi> Pay more added, to enable the Captain to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie his Creatures that deſerved his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; and for ſome time he had Orders for double Pay, I hope this was not for nothing; but that part of the Building ſoon fell down: I ſay, here is new Charges for him to place it upon his
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:47039:102"/>
                  <hi>Cocſwain, Steward,</hi> Servants, or whom he thinks good to deſerve it: The afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Clerk,</hi> I ſay, being one choſen by him, on hopes for him to prefer him to ſome Office, as he will deſerve by promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Intereſt, by the ſole management of the Purſer's Books, and the Officers Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts; and after his Maſter's turns are ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved therein, then his own muſt be next, and all the Officers Inſtructions given them, muſt be laid aſide, and ſerve no longer than thoſe ends they like of; and the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers muſt Trump up to this, or undergo what I have ſaid before; and if this be not <hi>Babel-Building,</hi> aſpiring to reach their Heaven, Wealth, and Deſpotical Power, the great Object of their Induſtry, and this to be raiſed out of Confuſion, I know not what to term it unto. But I doubt not but the Quick-ſighted will take timely warning to prevent the deſign of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralling the Power and Wealth of the Nation, and ſettle it again in good Order,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:47039:103"/>Method, and Government. As to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, the needfulneſs and neceſſarineſs thereof is, out of all doubt, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all that would live under a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in any Nation, City, Ship, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity; but the manner of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, is that which makes all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments differ, of which I will ſay in the Originals thereof, none differs which is thus; that whatſoever a Superior Officer does or commands to be done at his own will or choice, <hi>viz.</hi> that he may do it, or leave it undone, which Act or Order, if it exceeds not the bounds of Juſtice, Lenity, Kindneſs, and ſuch favourable Command as a Man might expect from his Father, Relation, or Friend, it is well, and according to the firſt Inſtitution of Government, and requires Allacrity in Obedience; but if it be Rigid, Auſtere, Moroſe, nay, Inhumane, and ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand as he may expect from his Captor,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:47039:103"/>or Enemy, then alſo he may obey: But how? As <hi>Tyranny</hi> is obeyed; wiſhing ill ſucceſs even to that, which he is out of neceſſity laying his hand to: For Mankind how weak ſoever they may be thought to be in the Wiles of Pollicy; yet this knowledge they have by Inſtinct of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if they are not told it by others; That from him that commands him he may expect as his due, Juſtice, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from all Wrongs from others, and to receive none from himſelf, nor any hardſhip, but what the Service muſt of neceſſity force his Officer to lay upon him, without doing any Man wrong to favour him; for if he does at any time do wrong to another to favour him, he by ſecret Inſtinct diſallows the Juſtice, and in his heart pronounces his Officer unjuſt, and expects the like Juſtice towards him when the wind of his Favour changes; ſo that Superior Officers, according to the Steps and Degrees of diſtance they were from
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:47039:104"/>the Commanded, ever were, and indeed ought to be as the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of old were; their Sons, Grandſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Generations had their degrees of Command over the whole Lineage, and all by due courſe of Seniority, in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Government Inſtituted by God Almighty; ſo that whenever they were (by the unfitneſs of the Senior to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, or conduct) forced to alter, they always choſe one of the ſame Lineage, neareſt of Kin, to govern and conduct the Tribe; this being God's Inſtitution to his Peculiar People for an Example to the reſt of the World; but the other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then in the World, as they were practiſed, might be ſuppoſed to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotical and Tyrannical: As <hi>Nimrod</hi> the mighty <hi>Hunter,</hi> who began the Firſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and was worſhipped as a God, and the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire after; but after that the Juſtice of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire, or <hi>Roman,</hi> in their Conqueſts,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:47039:104"/>may not in this <hi>Iſland</hi> eaſily be forgotten, (although <hi>Pagans;</hi>) but I leave it to Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and purſue my purpoſe, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> our Pattern; for ſo were all ſtiled that ſate in Judgment, or led the People; and they ever Treated all that came before them, with the Appellations of my Sons and Daughters. Likewiſe alſo did all Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals and Commanders treat all that came before them, for Juſtice to be done them; or to have Juſtice done on them, Mildly, Friendly, and with great Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency; and was ſorry for the <hi>Offender,</hi> even as a <hi>Father</hi> is ſorry for his <hi>own Son,</hi> when he is forced to correct him: But other ſorts of Government run parallel in the World, as thoſe mentioned, and alſo thereof are now extant, who may run their Bounds which God hath allotted them, for the Scourge of Mankind to ſerve his Eternal Purpoſes: Theſe alſo, I ſay, are obeyed; as I ſaid, through the Law of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:47039:105"/>Neceſſity, who carry their Commands over all, whom by Policy and Strength they have gotten under them, by Auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Moroſity; it being their Pollicy of Command to imitate Greatneſs in Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, Habiliments, Attendants, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, uſing overmuch Haughtineſs, and ſleighting Reſervedneſs, accompanied with Opprobrious and Villifying Terms to their Inferiors, even before the Faces of all Spectators; and ſpurn even them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their Caps caſt at their Feet in undue Honour and Reſpect paid them; all which is ſprung from a Weed gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lately in <hi>France,</hi> and planted in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whoſe Soil hath nouriſhed it, that it is ſuddenly grown to Magnitude inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable; and it is no other than a Relick of the Government, where Tyranny, Arbitrary, and Deſpotical Power is uſed and maintained, there being no other means for a Tyrant to have Obedience paid him by: The large, and once Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulent,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:47039:105"/>and Populous Dominions under the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> reduced to Poverty, and Paucity of People, may be a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Example thereof: And it is not to be doubted, but that God's appointed time for the Alteration of that Government, draweth nigh; it being a certain truth, That all Sublunary things have their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and Decreaſe, and never ſtand in a ſtate of ſteddineſs: So all <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Bodies,</hi> as Governments of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, Cities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have for their Strength and Glory, Increaſe, State, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe; but in its State it cannot ſtand long: For, as Doctor <hi>Heylen</hi> very well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, That the Elective Kingdom of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the Seigniory of <hi>Venice,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them of any great ſtrength com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to that Empire; yet they have held it at a ſtop near theſe Hundred Years, and, for five or ſix Years laſt paſt, may be noted, hath been under a great Declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; ſo may the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> in
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:47039:106"/>all probability, by another Obſervator, undergo an Alteration; having been at the top of its Power, ſignified by exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its power by Burning, Deſtroying, and Devaſtation of Countries; for that Kingdom cannot hope to enjoy a long continuance, that uſes ſuch ways for their Encreaſing and Maintaining; they do ſerve only for the Divine Vengeance of the Almighty's Decrees; for the Scourge of Mankind, to bring to paſs his Eternal Purpoſes: So I allude, That no Pollitie of Government, that is not grounded, and ſetled upon the Baſis and Foundations of the firſt Inſtitutions of Government, can conſiſt with the Welfare, and laſting Proſperity thereof; for that Government which is at the Will of the Governour, muſt either imply, That he that governs is ſomething more than a Man; nay, muſt be endued with all the Celeſtial Graces, and ſo permanent and ſteddy therein, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Imitation of the Deity; or
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:47039:106"/>elſe it will fall under all the Humane Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, that Mankind is ſubject unto, and what the product of them may be, I need not declare: Wherefore, for the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Mankind, for their Propagation and Government, in all well-ſetled Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, were added to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, juſt and wholſome Laws deviſed and enacted by the Sages, Elders, and Heads of the People, for them to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by; in which the People ſaw their Inſtructions for their Duties at large, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated to them; as alſo the Rocks and Precipices they were to ſhun, from being made Shipwracks of by the State; ſo that all the Inferiour Officers in that State or Pollicy, hath in the ſame their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Inſtructions for their Offices; all which Inſtructions, or Conſtitutions ran ever from between the Governor, Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, Inferior, and all degrees of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers conſiſtant to Unity and Concordance, all tending to one end and deſign, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:47039:107"/>the Welfare of the Governor and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned; and in the doing of which, they might ſtand and be juſtifiable before their Superiors, and ſhall be Freed, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by their Parity; of which this Nation hath no ſmall reaſon for its pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice to bleſs God; which leads me to a practice of the <hi>Navy,</hi> not much to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, which is this:</p>
               <p>That all Warranted Officers upon any ſmaller Offences, have been Caned, Bilboed, Deſpitefully intreated, and made vile and Contemptible to the Ships Company, and perhaps upon ſlight Occaſions: And again, if the Crime hath been greater, and deſerved to be brought to a <hi>Council of War,</hi> or <hi>Court-Marſhal,</hi> there even his Accuſer ſhall be one of his Judges; or at leaſt he ſhall be Judged and Condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Superiors; and perhaps of the ſame Claſs of his Accuſer, wherein his Parities are wholly excluded; now how this agrees to the Municipal Laws of this
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:47039:107"/>Nation, to which they are all Subjects, and what Juſtice they may expect, may be gueſſed at: To ſay no more, but that I do not admire it; for the Peers of this Nation claim to be Judged by their Peers, and the Commons by their Parity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, as it is all my endeavour in this Diſcourſe to invite into the Government of the <hi>Navy,</hi> all poſſible Juſt and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Proceedings, adminiſtred with Mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Clemency towards Offenders for their Shame and Puniſhment; ſo is it no leſs my aim and deſire to Inculcate that with Affection, and no leſs Juſtice, for the due Reward, and deſerved Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements of all Experienced, Active, Vigilant, Honeſt, and Valiant Officers, Preferments be freely and indifferently granted; and to let the warm Beams of Favours, even like the Beams of the Sun ſhine indifferently upon all Heads, and not to have it confined to Private Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations on Private Intereſt. As,</p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:47039:108"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> For Puniſhment in Criminals, where Life is queſtioned, why it may not be conſiſtant to the Municipal Laws of this Nation, that a Warrant Officer be Tryed by a Jury of Twelve Warrant Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and the Council or Court ſitting, and ſuperſeding, as the Judges and Juſtices at the Aſſizes; I know no reaſon to the contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> For Crimes of <hi>Petty larconies,</hi> for Stores, Cowardice, Ill-behaviour in Battle, Diſobedience to Command, or any Offence which may require either Corporal or Pecuniary Puniſhment to be inflicted; if it be brought to a <hi>Court-Marſhal,</hi> Why they may not be Tryed by their Parity, I know not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Where they deſerve to be Degraded and Diſcarded, why they may not be Judged, and undergo their Parities Sentence as to Matter of Fact, and be ſent either to the <hi>Admiral</hi> at Sea, or to the <hi>Lord High Admiral</hi> within the Narrow-Seas,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:47039:108"/>or Rivers, to be dealt with as they ſhall think fit? For then the Merit of the Cauſe will appear, <hi>viz.</hi> Matter of Fact, and not be turned out barely upon the Captains Word or Letter; which never yet was practiſed, till of late Years, and ſprang from the Root I ſo often ſpoke of before: Now as I ſpoke before, that Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Concordant Inſtructions are moſt needful to be given to all Officers for the Performance of their reſpective Duties; ſo that I here intimate, That upon the proof of Fact, the breach of their Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions would be a ready Condemnation, if conſiderable for their Diſmiſſion; as alſo their Performance a Juſtification for them, without which can be nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, but Diſtraction, Confuſion, and Arbitrary Proceedings: And then for their Encouragements by Preferments, Why may not their Capacities and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities be alſo taken notice of, when certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Warranted Officers, that are
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:47039:109"/>reckoned ancient experienced Men of the ſame Employments, ſome nominated, and appointed for Probators, as well as all from the Captains and Commiſſioners; and let no Certificates be made or valued, that hath more than one Hand to it, who ought to certifie no more than he knows to be true of that Man; and let ſome body of Credit alſo certifie of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Sober Life, and a conſtant Adherer to the Government eſtabliſhed, both in Church and State; the Certificates being all ſingle, if it happens not to be true, it ſhould reflect upon the Certifier to his damage, to certifie a Lye; and thereby indeavouring to introduce into the Affair (as lately) <hi>Papiſts</hi> and other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, that the Management of the Affair of the <hi>Navy</hi> ſhould not be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto, and Peſtered with, to avoid Diviſions, Party-makings, Trickings, and Deſignings, as I have elſewhere ſpoken, inſtead of Unity and Concord to be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:47039:109"/>as there inſtanced: I ſay, Why theſe, or the like may not be done, I find no Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Indeed ſome may ſay, that by Trying by Parities, and the like, by Certificates, there would run ſuch a Propenſity in them towards the favour of their own Employments, that it would not anſwer the end deſcribed.</p>
               <p>To which I Anſwer: If the Officers were all choſen for good Qualifications, as I before intimated, no doubt but that there would be as Impartial Proceedings as could be expected; but if the Officers be made only from the Captains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> on their bare Recommendations, as of late; then there may be expected ſuch Officers, as hath, or can, by the Art of Fawning, Flattery, Slaviſh and Obſequious Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of the Captain or his Creatures; or for ſome ſervice done, not very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in its ſelf, yet beſpeaks him to be in the Captains Favour: I ſay, from
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:47039:110"/>ſuch Officers cannot be expected much Juſtice: But this Argument, that no Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice may be expected from them, you may as well ſay ſo of all the Proceedings of the <hi>Courts of Juſtice</hi> in the <hi>Nation:</hi> You may by the ſame reaſon put by all the Juries of the Kingdom, and pretend their Partiality to their Equals, and Try all Matters by the Judges and Juſtices of the <hi>Benches,</hi> and by ſuch as the King ſhall Commiſſionate for that purpoſe, and then may you have ſuch a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at Land, as you deſire at Sea; and only then you will be ſenſible thereof: And this is a Fruit born on another Branch of that Weed I have ſo often mentioned; the which, if it ſhould be uſed ſo on the Land, I ſay, it would be very Unſavory Fruit to the Palates of the Nation.</p>
               <p>But ſome Man will ſay, that there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a proper Compariſon between the Government at Sea, and the Land.</p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:47039:110"/>
               <p>I Anſwer. It is very fit and proper; for they are the ſame People that govern the one and the other, <hi>viz.</hi> Commiſſioned and Deputed; and the ſame that obey at Sea, and at Land; and the ſame Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers for the Government of the one as the other; and Juſtice bears the ſame Face, and is the Attribute of God, and as much required at Sea, as at Land.</p>
               <p>Having, I think, ſaid enough to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince any Moderate Man herein, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Emoluments and Profits of the Officers, as a Recompence to each Man for his Labour, and Jeoparding his Liberty, Limbs, and Life it ſelf, for the ſupport of their Familes; a great Object to them in their Abſence, or Death, or for their Maintainance in Old Age, Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and loſs of Limbs; which is by certain Wages allotted them; Allowances of Perquiſites in divers Caſes and Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents happening; as alſo by Prizes taken, and by Goods and Moneys acquired by
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:47039:111"/>Adventures; and alſo their Privileges for themſelves, and Inſtruments under them, that they be not abuſed, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced, nor their Cabins Store-Rooms, and Eaſements taken from them, and abridged of all Happineſs, or Healthy Living on Board, by being too ſtrait-lac'd, and confined; all which are according to antient Preſcriptions, and known Cuſtoms and Practices of the <hi>Navy Royal</hi> to be their Dues. Now if the Government thereof, is become <hi>Arbitrary;</hi> and if any one is abridged thereof, and his Profits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> either taken from him, diverted to others, or converted to the Commanders Profit; every one ſo ſerved, muſt needs be grieved, and diſappointed of his hopes for his preſent Maintainance; and alſo for his Old Age, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo hath he ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for nought but Miſery and Contempt: Now if there be no Appeal for that Party lying, with ſome reaſonable ſafety, to complain to the <hi>Lord High Admiral,</hi> or
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:47039:111"/>to his Deputies, <hi>viz.</hi> the Commiſſioners of the <hi>Navy,</hi> for his Redreſs; I mean, that it might lie open and eaſie for him to have acceſs to be heard, and that there he may expect Juſtice indifferently to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred: I ſay, if there be not, a Man may eaſily conclude, that Government to be Deſpotical and Unjuſt; I mean an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal that a Man may come off with Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, being protected from the future Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries he may receive from the Offender, by the anger or malice of him that hath done the wrong, by reaſon of this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal taken: For it is recommended by God unto Man, to defend the Weak and Oppreſſed, and to reſiſt the Proud; meaning, That the ſtrong Man be bound by a ſtronger than he, and made to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the Wronged to his Right, and let him not dare to injure him again; but not as it is, to force a Prey out of a Lyon's Paw, and let him looſe to the Party, whoſe Right it is to be protected, to be
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:47039:112"/>worried by him to death afterwards; I mean, that Juſtice be plentifully admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred on Board the Ships, that it might flow even out at the Scuppers; then will Mens Hearts be glad in the Service, and bear their Labours, Watchings, Pains, and Hazards, with Allacrity, and have cauſe to bleſs God, for the Promoters and Maintainers of theſe Bleſſings under God unto them; and from ſuch Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may be expected, Proſperity and Happineſs to the Affair, and Atchievement of great Actions abroad, to the Glory, Honour, and Wealth of the Nation; and the <hi>Navy</hi> be in a Progreſſive motion, as I at firſt intimated.</p>
               <p>Again, The Government of the Ships at Sea, was, That in Times of all conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable dangers approaching, <hi>viz.</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were beſt to Engage, or which way to manage it; which way, or what courſe to ſteer; if it be beſt to cut a Maſt; and in fine, in all great and important Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:47039:112"/>if the Commander did not call his Warrant Officers together for Council, and took their Sentiments in the majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and put it in execution; but executed his own Will, and thereby Miſchief en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued; it would have been very hard for him to have eſcaped deſerved Shame and Puniſhment; for his Officers are, or ought to be material Limbs, or Parts of that Government; and in all Difficulties their Concurrence ought to be taken; but the practice of late, is clean otherwiſe: I ſay, his Officers being not awed by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on him, would have witneſſed freely the truth, and have laid the blame, or the burthen of the Miſcarriage, upon the right ſhoulders: but no ſuch thing can be practiſed, where Deſpotical Power is: It is meer Nonſenſe to pretend exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining of Parties, hoping to come to the truth of the Matter of Fact, when the Witneſſes dare not ſpeak truth; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if they know that a well packt
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:47039:113"/>Lye, or cunning evading of the truth, will better pleaſe the Court: Nay, if the Horſe muſt of neceſſity be ſadled, how eaſie may a Man wilfully put it upon the wrong Horſe, when he knows it is not ſafe for him to put it on the right, for fear of being ſpoiled? I ſay, it is meer mockery, or but a ſhadow of due Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and is alſo of the Unſavory Fruit, I elſewhere mentioned.</p>
               <p>Again, if a Ship happens to meet with Diſaſters at Sea; and that not for want of Careleſneſs, and neglect of Duty, to the endangering of Ship and Lives; and when ſhe comes home, there be no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner, or Surveyor, of power to call all the Officers before him, and examine the truth; to find out how, and by what means it came to paſs, and to know the true ſtate of the thing, and what is moſt neceſſary to be done now, for the good, and beneficial managing of the ſame for the King and Service, and by knowing
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:47039:113"/>the truth of the Accident; they may be able to put a Preventer for the future like Accidents: But, I ſay, inſtead of this proceeding, if there be a Letter writ, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known to the Captain, and there be another Ship ordered for him, and the other laid by, and the <hi>King</hi> damaged Five Hundred or a Thouſand Pounds, and the Service impeded thereby; Will any one think this a right Method? But as for Examining, I had almoſt forgotten what I ſaid, even now, That it muſt be Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe to expect the truth to be known, where ſuch Dependances are upon Arbitrary Power: And therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, it muſt be alſo the baneful Fruit of the foreſaid Weed. I could inſtance ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more Particulars, which are the true, and genuine Fruits of the ſaid Weed; but I ſuppoſe, by what hath been already ſaid, will be ſufficient proof of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſomneſs of him, and therefore fit to be rooted up.</p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:47039:114"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I will deſcend to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſtanding Officers of this ſaid Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo called, for that they are War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the <hi>Admiralty;</hi> for each Ship, during life, in caſe they commit no Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanour worthy of their being turned out; and at the receipt of thoſe War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants they do, or ought to receive, alſo ample and plenary Inſtructions for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of their Offices, who are the <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, Boatſwain, Gunner,</hi> and <hi>Carpenter;</hi> unto whom are committed all the Stores of the ſaid Ship, or Service; and for the ſecuring, preſerving, and laying the ſame up to be ready upon all minute Accidents for the ſaid Service.</p>
               <p>They by ancient Preſcriptions and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms have allotted them Appartments of the ſaid Ship, proper for the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> Cabins, Steward-Room, Store-Rooms, and Accommodations, and Avenues to the ſame, for themſelves and their Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, to perform their reſpective
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:47039:114"/>Offices under them: Now if they be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridged thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> curtailed, leſſened, or taken from them, at the Will of the Captain, it is not eaſie to judge, what Damages may enſue to the King and and Service thereby: Unto which may be added, the Diſcomfiture by Loſſes the Officers may ſuſtain; for they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to the <hi>King,</hi> by way of Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſigned for the ſame. As for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The <hi>Purſer,</hi> and no other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of the Ship, at his receipt of his War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, gives Bond to the King, with two ſufficient Sureties, with a Penalty of Five Hundred Pounds, more or leſs, according to the Rate of the ſaid Ship, which Bonds, in caſe of failure of his Duty, are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Eſtreated in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and Proceſs are iſſued out, for the Seiſures of Body and Eſtates of him, or his Sureties, of what Eſtate ſoever they were poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of, during the time of their being
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:47039:115"/>Accomptants to the King: Now if the Inſtructions they receive for their Duties, be not ſufficient to bear them harmleſs in the performance thereof; and that they be not conſonant to the Captains, nay, nothing more contrary, or leſs obſerved in proceeding; How poſſibly can this Man be in any degree of ſafety, or Friends giving Pledge for him, let him be never ſo <hi>good</hi> an Officer? (I ſay none.)</p>
               <p>But it is Anſwered, The Captain is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable at the Determination of the Voyage, by the ſtoppage of his Pay; the which he is not to receive until he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes his Accounts, required by his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, by giving in Journals of his Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and Muſter, and Checque-Books, and a Certificate from each ſtanding Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, that he hath not commanded any thing, during the Voyage, irregular; for which he hath a Clerk allowed him to perform for him; which Checque-Book the <hi>Purſer</hi> ſees not till a long time after,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:47039:115"/>and may be ruined thereby; and there is alſo added unto him, double Allowance of <hi>Midſhipmen</hi>'s Pays to each Rate, for him to diſpoſe of, as I ere-whiles mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: All this being a late Invention, to bear the reſemblance of a ſafe Method, for the <hi>King,</hi> and Sub-Officers; yet it proves but as a <hi>Shooing-Horn</hi> to draw on more Charges to the <hi>King</hi> and Service, and as <hi>Cobwebs,</hi> in the behalf of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, to bind a ſtrong Man with: For it is an evident encreaſe of the <hi>King's</hi> Charges, and the maintaining more <hi>Cooks,</hi> which, according to the old Proverb, <hi>Is a marring the Pottage.</hi> And,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the binding him, it is on the quite contrary; for it gives him the greater Latitude of Arbitrary Power and Command, to awe the Officer to Sign the ſaid Certificate, and to comply to his, and his Creatures Pleaſures, concerning the Stores, Books, and Proceedings of the Ships Accounts. I forbear Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:47039:116"/>to inſtance more, there being room enough, by what hath been ſaid, to gueſs: For before this Invention, by the antient practice of the <hi>Navy,</hi> he was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, by the ſtoppage of his Pay, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Complaints of his Officers, for his Irregular Commands; but this put him into more Deſpotical Power, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe of the Stores; and by a Daſh of his Clerk's Pen, to ruine both the Officer's Voyage and Reputation, in caſe he Signs not ſuch a Certificate as required: So that this alſo ſeems to me, to be a Fruit of the Weed aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Purſer</hi>'s Inſtructions former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and now, they are the ſame <hi>verba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim;</hi> but for the Obſervation of them, there remains nothing thereof, ſaving to paſs his Accounts, the which he is forced to, by his triple Bond aforeſaid; the which, if it were alſo omitted, the Laws, for all that are Accomptants to the <hi>King,</hi> to adjuſt, were ſufficient Tyes for him:
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:47039:116"/>So that the whole matter of his Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as they are put in practice of late, ſince this new Invention, I will (not to deſcend to Particulars) bind them up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as uſeleſs; except it be to expoſe them to the Ridicule of the Captains and Lieutenants: and to be uſed when they have occaſion to go into the Gallery.</p>
               <p>Now, as I ſaid, the <hi>Purſer</hi> Indents for the <hi>Proviſions,</hi> and iſſues the ſame by his Inſtruments; with which <hi>Proviſions,</hi> he receives, or ought to do, an Allowance of Money, <hi>viz.</hi> Fourteen Pence <hi>per</hi> Month, for every Perſon in the Ship, to find <hi>Candle, Wood, Canns, Platters, Spoons, Lanthorns,</hi> &amp;c. called Neceſſaries for the Ship; but the little or much Neceſſaries, <hi>viz.</hi> profuſe Expences thereof, is at the Pleaſure of the Captains and Lieutenants to command; and how that is of late ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, is too tedious for my intended Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe: Alſo, what kind of reſpect the <hi>Proviſions</hi> meet with in hoiſting into
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:47039:117"/>the Ship, and Stowage of them, and of the Remains to be hoiſted out, to be ſent a Shoar to be preſerved; and <hi>Cask-wood,</hi> and what relates to his Stores, it going under the notion of the <hi>Purſer</hi>'s, he being bound to anſwer for it as beforeſaid. I could ſay much therein, but I leave that to every Man to relate his own caſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he finds his uſage: But this I will ſay in general, That ſince the Project of the Captains being <hi>Purſers,</hi> have been promoted, both the <hi>Purſers,</hi> and their Inſtruments, have gone under great Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal and Obloquy; inſomuch, that the <hi>Purſer</hi> can get no Inſtruments, but at a dear and uncertain rate, to act under him, by reaſon of Ridicule and evil Treatment; and I do moderately calculate it, That if the Captain had the Victualling, he would ſave of what is now profuſely ſpent, and waſted malitiouſly with Sallaries, which the <hi>Purſer</hi> pays, and Moneys he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to ſpend, to ſoften Mens Moroſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:47039:117"/>towards his Affairs, that he might come to the leſs damages, ſufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for a very good Officer for his Voyage: By means whereof, as it is now carried in the Offices at home, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand abroad, that when he has paſt his Accounts, he will have nothing left to ſupport his Family, or maintain him in his Old Age: I ſay, if he be an Honeſt and Upright Man in his Office, and do not Fawn, Flatter, and Trick it, and truckle to the Creatures he has to deal with, the which is now become his Fate; and therefore, I wiſh him to furniſh himſelf with a well-tempered Diſpoſition, <hi>To be as Wiſe as a Serpent, and as Harmleſs as a Dove;</hi> patient of Wrongs, a good Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour-monger; and carry a good <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum</hi> in his Pocket, that will diſſolve Moroſe, Obdurate, and Flinty Tempers; or elſe better Fortune, than to be caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo ill a reputed, and diſreſpected an Office: All which Fate is befallen him, and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:47039:118"/>is an effect of that ill Weed I ſpake of come from <hi>France,</hi> and hath infected the <hi>Naval Affairs</hi> of <hi>England</hi> with a Scurvey Diſeaſe, and, if not in time cured, it may taint the Vital Spirits thereof; and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it to be decrepid, and <hi>of ſlow mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Boatſwain,</hi> he is an Officer that Indents for all the <hi>Sails, Cables, Cordage,</hi> and <hi>Stores</hi> of the Ship, and by the Captain's Hand to the Expence, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes his Account with the <hi>Clerk of the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey:</hi> As doth alſo the <hi>Carpenter</hi> for the <hi>Maſts, Yards, Planks, Boards, Spikes, Nails,</hi> and many Particulars: The <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> with the <hi>Officers of the Ordnance for the Guns, all ſorts of Shot, Powder,</hi> and many particular <hi>Stores of Artillery.</hi> Now heretofore, nay, yet it is in the <hi>Purſer</hi>'s Inſtructions, although I left them, even now, in the Gallery, for the Captains and Lieutenants uſes: I ſay, the <hi>Purſer</hi> was required, and did enter from time to
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:47039:118"/>time, the Weekly Expences of both <hi>Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwain, Gunner,</hi> and <hi>Carpenter</hi>'s Accounts into a Ledger; and drew a Monthly, or oftner Account for the Captain, and took the Captain, and Maſter's Hands, to whom the Expence was known, and Signed it himſelf, and gave it them to paſs their Accounts by; but, I ſay, ſince the new Project aforeſaid, it is uſeleſs, and the <hi>Captain</hi>'s <hi>Clerk</hi> is inſtead of a Servant of the Captains; and by what hath been ſaid before, may be eaſily gueſſed, what ſafety in the Affair to the <hi>King,</hi> may be expected, and what dependance the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers have, and on whom it is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p>Again, If the Ship happens to fall into great Action, as it often does, and that good Exploits are done, either for the Preſervation of the Men and Ship, or in damaging the Enemy, the Practice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hath been uſed of late, to take the full Relation of the ſaid Action, from the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:47039:119"/>Captains and Lieutenants Mouths, or Writings; and the other Officers are Mutes in that caſe; how eaſily then may the matter be repreſented, and the truth thereof either lie hid, and Honour and Rewards be placed unduly, and undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly, by Intereſt, or Influence of the Repreſenters made, and inſtead of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke for Misbehaviour, Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to the diſcouragement of the well-deſerving; and the ſtifling of the truth of the Fact, from the knowledge of the <hi>Admiral, Commander in Chief, Lord High Admiral,</hi> and <hi>Commiſſioners at home:</hi> For it cannot be thought, that the Captains and Lieutenants have all the Eyes in the Ship that ſee, or all the Hands that act therein; but that other good Officers may be in the Ship, that may ſee that which they do not, and do that which they do not; for they have like opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with them, by their Speculations, Motions, and Converſings in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:47039:119"/>Places and Duties; they having Eyes to ſee, and Hands to act with, more than two or three; and Converſe through the whole Ship by themſelves, their Mates, and Inſtruments.</p>
               <p>Now upon any ſuch extraordinary Occaſions or Accidents, if there were a Commiſſioner of the <hi>Navy,</hi> in the Ports and Roads, or one deputed from the <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> at Sea, (with the aſſiſtance of his Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,) who did go on Board the ſaid Ship, and ſummon before him all the Officers of the ſaid Ship, and take their Examinations; and if need be, their Depoſitions, to the Matters in queſtion; and freedom for any one to come in and declare their knowledge of the Action; then may the truth be known, and a right Information be tranſmitted to the Superior Power, whether abroad or at home: For the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes before mentioned, which looks like direct proceeding, if it be ſolemnly done, but the contrary, is a Fruit of the former Weed.</p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:47039:120"/>
               <p>Again, The Ships heretofore had not ſo great Accommodations for <hi>Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> as of late; for every Builder hath ſtriven to exceed each other, in making <hi>Accommodations</hi> for the <hi>Captains;</hi> for which, it coſteth the King no ſmall Charges: Nay, I ſay, great Charges; yet that does not give content but rarely; for he is reckoned a Man of but ſmall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, that cannot continue to make great alteration in the <hi>Steeridge, Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, Cabins, Store-Rooms,</hi> &amp;c. and a great deal of Work for <hi>Carpenters, Joyners, Painters,</hi> &amp;c. And as the Currant has run, ſcarce deſir'd it of the <hi>Commiſſioner;</hi> but if he does, to be ſure its never denied him; and theſe Alterations are ſure to be the enlargement of their own <hi>Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and the <hi>Abridgment</hi> of others: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the <hi>Accommodations</hi> he hath contrived by the <hi>Builders,</hi> ten to one, but he is to enlarge his <hi>Store-Room,</hi> and confines the <hi>Steward-Room</hi> into ſo
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:47039:120"/>ſmall a <hi>Room,</hi> that it is a miſerable place to handle the Ships <hi>Proviſions</hi> in, from which proceeds no ſmall damage; many times to the <hi>King</hi> in his <hi>Proviſions,</hi> and alſo the <hi>Purſer;</hi> and the <hi>Cock-pit,</hi> a Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Pit, to tranſact the moſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant buſineſs of the Ship; and by the thronging it with Cabins for Creatures, Boys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they are meerly choaked up: And to add to it, the <hi>Steeridges</hi> are generally taken away from the Officers, that they ſhall not Eat, nor Walk, nor Refreſh themſelves; the way going out of the <hi>Steeridge</hi> to the <hi>Gun-Room</hi> being totally ſhut up, and in divers, a <hi>Pantry</hi> contrived for the <hi>Captains;</hi> ſo that the Ship is made uſeleſs for a cloſe Fight: For the <hi>Communication</hi> between the Decks, is ſhut up; and all that were wont formerly to go from the <hi>Gun-Room,</hi> and ſome <hi>abaft</hi> the <hi>Maſt,</hi> up and down through the <hi>Steeridge,</hi> are all confined to go up and down at a ſmall <hi>Scuttle</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:47039:121"/>out the <hi>Steeridge, abaft</hi> the <hi>Maſt;</hi> where all are to paſs and repaſs, with their hot Meat, Lame and Sick Men; and in any Weather at Sea, the Boats hoiſted in, Ports Caulked, and <hi>Tarpallings</hi> laid; there is all the paſſage for the whole Ships Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany below the Deck, and all the Air can be ſpared them: Officers and all, if but a ſudden Allarm of Weather, Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, or Enemy happen, you would bleſs your ſelf to ſee Men tumble on one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Backs, and a long while before got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten up: No wonder if the Men fall ſick, and Infections run from one end of the Ship to the other, and the <hi>Proviſions</hi> Taint, and grow ſtinking: <hi>Butter, Cheeſe,</hi> and <hi>Bread,</hi> in a little time after received, prove unfit to be eaten; <hi>Peaſe,</hi> and <hi>Oat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal</hi> grow Muſty, and the Men extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtifled, for want of Air: If ſuch things ſhould have been done in <hi>Blake, Lawſon, Minns,</hi> or any of the former <hi>Commanders in Chief</hi> their Times, they would ſoon
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:47039:121"/>have been turned to ſeek for Commands; and for the Warrant Officers, they live more like Dogs; I mean, <hi>Spaniels</hi> than Men, <hi>For he, by Nature, Fawns on him that beats him;</hi> ſo ought a Warrant Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer to do, if the Cane of his Captain, comes over his Shoulders; there is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Remedy, than to be like the <hi>Spaniel:</hi> Nay, I am much miſtaken, if Lieutenants ſcruple to ſtrike a Warrant Officer, and that upon ſlight occaſions: But I am now ſomething in Paſſion on this matter, but I hold, and am really not deſirous to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the matter, but rather to caſt a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle over it a while; but if I had ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, I had ſaid nothing to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; but out of the whole bundle, I draw you theſe few Samples, by which you may know the reſt; and if I am not miſtaken, the Officers muſt be pitiful ſmall-ſoul'd Men, and know little, and cannot poſſibly be Men fit for their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, as they ought; for they muſt
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:47039:122"/>acquire their Offices, by thoſe ways I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly told, and muſt have a Faculty of Lying, Fawning, Flattering, and Creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Captains Servants; for it's well if they be not too high for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe: I am ſure they are better accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated, and have more quiet Enjoyment; for they have the <hi>Steeridge</hi> and <hi>Cabins</hi> at large, and the Warrant Officers have no way to the Air from between Decks, but under the Louſie Hammocks, and Sick Bodies in the way, where the Men are hung in bundles, the Ports Caulked in, no breathing, but the Stench of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Abominable Proceedings, Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Command, and Prepoſterous Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, and ſuch as, I thought, I ſhould never have lived to have ſeen an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship ſo governed, much more in general; yet out of it ſome are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, but too few. Alſo this ſmells rank of the ſaid Weed.</p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:47039:122"/>
               <p>Again, The Ship is furniſhed with Boats, <hi>viz. Barge,</hi> or <hi>Pinnace, Yawle,</hi> and <hi>Long-Boat,</hi> according to the Rate of the Ship; and it hath been meant former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that theſe Boats were to be ſerviceable to the Ship, and Company, in tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them on Board, and on Shoar, with Neceſſaries, and Conveniencies that may be wanted, for the Company, at the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and direction of the Captain: Now if ſuch Commands are carried, that no Officer dare to ask, or expect to have a Boat, upon any urgent occaſion, for the tranſporting himſelf, Stores, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the execution of his Office, upon his reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Requeſt, but muſt hire Boats: Nay, that an Officer cannot be carried on Shoar, or on Board, but ſlightingly refuſed, left behind the Ship, himſelf and Stores, and in Places and Times when Boats cannot be had for Love, nor Money: I mean, when the Practice is ſuch, that his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour ſhall declare it beneath him, to go
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:47039:123"/>in Boat with his Officer; or, that the Lieutenants ſhall be in their Commands, ſleighting their Officers, and Mariners, for their Tranſports on Board, or on Shoar, with their Servants, and Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, for their <hi>reaſonable Accommodation;</hi> and are thereby left behind, or put to great Shifts, and Charges therein; and a general Diſregard, and Diſreſpect ſhewed them before the Company: So that all the whole Series of the Command, in the Affairs of the Ship, runs upon hard terms, in ſleighting, and Contemptible uſage of Warrant Officers, the Particulars being too many to mention here; all which are ſprang up of late, in the practice of the <hi>Sea Commands,</hi> ſince the planting of the aforeſaid Weed; were it not a Protection of ſuch <hi>Imperial Commands,</hi> to ſettle <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary,</hi> and <hi>Deſpotical Power</hi> at Sea, as I have before ſhewed: It would not have found ſuch a Harmony in ſo many of the <hi>Commiſſioned Officers,</hi> to act in ſo direct a
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:47039:123"/>Line to the ſaid Mark. But thoſe <hi>Babel-Builders,</hi> as I ſaid elſewhere, having been diſappointed of their Deſigns, by God's Providence on the Nation, on Shoar, and the <hi>Builders</hi> divided and diſperſed: So I doubt not, but that the <hi>Navy</hi> alſo, may feel the warmth of the Divine Favour, to diſpel the <hi>Sulphurous Vapours</hi> of that <hi>noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Weed</hi> of <hi>Arbitrary, Deſpotical</hi> and <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical Power,</hi> and pack it away to the Frippery of thoſe dark Regions of <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi>'s Kingdom, by <hi>whoſe Contrivance,</hi> and for <hi>whoſe Dominion</hi> it was only calculated and invented, uſhered in by <hi>Superſtition,</hi> and <hi>Idolatry;</hi> but to our <hi>Sovereigns,</hi> and their Kingdoms, <hi>God</hi> grant there be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, a laſting <hi>Monarchy,</hi> Governing by wholſome Laws, Watered, and Pruned by multitude of Council, wherein there is ſafety; and never to root up the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Plants, and Scions engrafted, and moiſtened with the Blood of our <hi>Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:47039:124"/>viz. The Fundamental Laws eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in Church and State.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, They being the eſſential parts of Government, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Civil,</hi> as well as <hi>Military,</hi> which are both to be here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected; I mean, for Men to be kept in due obedience to the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> of the Nation; the Executor of which Laws, is the Captain: Now if he does not cauſe a ſtrict Enquiry to be had, when <hi>Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> and <hi>Thefts</hi> are committed on Board, Mens <hi>Cheſts</hi> broken up, their <hi>Cloaths, Victuals, Moneys,</hi> or <hi>Goods</hi> ſtollen from them; for it is a very hard matter to have a Search, (or dare any to accuſe ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, becauſe they are Favourites, or ſo far off) as the Favourite of a Favourite, becauſe it is not eaſie for any one to bring his matter into proof, every one doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it is not ſafe to give in Evidence againſt one that has favour: And in fine, thy meaning is, when Juſtice is admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to the People at ſuch a diſtance, and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:47039:124"/>at ſuch hazard to receive it, that it were better to let it alone than to receive it; that then <hi>Theft, Robbery, Coſening, Cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and all Wrongs to each other, muſt needs be very rife: As for Example.</p>
               <p>If the Itinerant Judges of the Nation, ſhould omit the Execution of their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the <hi>Circuits;</hi> as alſo the <hi>Judicial Courts</hi> aloft in the <hi>Terms,</hi> at their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures? What manner of Living, for ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Goods,</hi> or <hi>Lives</hi> could be expected in ſuch Government? Will you ſay it is the <hi>Captain</hi>'s Pleaſure to remit the wrong done to <hi>Tom</hi> by <hi>Jack,</hi> and let the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der go free? By the ſame Rule, the Judge may pardon the Offender, that is accuſed of wrong done to his Neighbour: This is alſo a Fruit of the aforeſaid Weed, and would be very unſavory to the Palates on Shoar: And why not on Board, I know not. But, as I ſaid before, Juſtice ought to run down, as a mighty ſtream, that the meaneſt of the Ship may catch it in
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:47039:125"/>their Caps at will; nor do I believe, that the Captain hath power to diſpence with any of the <hi>Punitive</hi> Laws of the Nation, provided againſt <hi>Pettilarconies,</hi> or <hi>Thefts, Burglaries,</hi> of Breaking, or Picking of Locks, <hi>Pocket-picking, Cheating,</hi> Borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and not Paying, but that falls more immediately under the Pay of the Ship; but all things that may be executed at Sea, ought to be done by the Antient Laws and Conſtitutions of the <hi>Seas,</hi> and not to ſuſpend the Execution thereof at the Captain's Will; but if it be more proper to ſuſpend the Execution thereof, till come to a <hi>Flag,</hi> or <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> a ſhoar, that then alſo, although it be not under his power, yet then he ought to bear ſuch favour to Juſtice, as to defend the Innocent, and bring the Offender to Puniſhment; that he ſhould make it his buſineſs to become as an Advocate for the wronged Party. I ſay, where you find theſe Matters of Juſtice to be ſtopt
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:47039:125"/>in the Currents; and, that Abuſes, Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries, Cheatings, Revellings, Brawlings, and Batteries, are frequently committed, and ſeldom taken notice of for redreſs, except to a Favourite: Nay, the very Proviſions of the Ship, embezelled, and abuſed; and many Enormous Outrages committed: And, I ſay, Redreſſes not freely, heartily, and indifferently admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred; that there you may ſee the plain Fruit of <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> and that <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander</hi> is glutted with it, and wants a ſtrong Purge of the Extracts of <hi>Abdica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, after the <hi>Military</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Ship, although worthy of Preference, yet it comes in here to bring up the Rear, <hi>viz. Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the keeping the People to the due Reſort to the <hi>publick Service,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Laws of the Nation; and to obſerve as well the Neglecters thereof, through an Atheiſtical, Debauched, and
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:47039:126"/>Irreligious Temper; as the Contemners, <hi>viz.

And moreover, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he finds the Practice of Their Majeſties are towards <hi>differing Perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> in their Government, provided it be not againſt the Fundamental Laws of the Nation, ſo ought he to be conſonant thereto in his Government; but on the contrary, if he ſhall favour <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi> or thoſe that were ſo lately, and keep them in his Favour, endeavouring to prefer them to Employments, or that he ſhall ſo diſpoſe his Favours, that it ever tends to a particular Party, whatſoever it be that is repugnant to the Eſtabliſhed Laws of the Nation; he does endeavour thereby, to introduce, foſter, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Diviſion in the Fleet, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:47039:126"/>in the Nation, and doth not ſerve the Publick, according to the Compact and Conditons he received his Commiſſion upon, and thereto plights his Troth; but with that part of the Wealth and Strength of the Nation that he is intruſted with, does endeavour, what lies in him, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Employers; and cauſes their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be expended, contrary to their Wills, or Knowledge, to the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance of theirs, and the Nations Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <hi>viz.</hi> the Enemies of the Laws, which are the Enemies of the Nation; which is to <hi>Tantamount</hi> holding Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and diſpoſing of the Treaſure of the Nation to their Enemies.</p>
               <p>Again, If the <hi>Captain</hi> be a <hi>Drunkard, Swearer, Curſer, Lyer, Cheater, Gamer, profuſe Spendthrift, Riotous, Reviler, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidinous Whore-monger,</hi> or <hi>Flagitiouſly wicked,</hi> where any, or many of theſe, or the like Sins, are eminently found in him, his Service cannot be good; and alſo his
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:47039:127"/>Examples are very taking to the Officers, and <hi>Mariners</hi> in general; and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, where <hi>Deſpotical Power</hi> is exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: For it has been an Obſervation made on the Lives of the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> That in the Life of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> he made Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men to flouriſh, and the Empire to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with them; <hi>Tiberius</hi> his Succeſſor, made the Empire to abound with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched Perſons, Sycophants, and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains; <hi>Trajan</hi> with grave Men, and good Soldiers; ſo likewiſe here a Debauched Captain can never expect a ſober Ships Company, and the like of all other Vices: So that, I ſay, the Example of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in the Government of the Ship, carries with it as great Imitation, as any thing I know.</p>
               <p>Again, How can it be expected, that a Captain that Swears at a ſhameful rate, and Damns at every Sentence almoſt, can command, according to the antient Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the <hi>Navy,</hi> or the preſent
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:47039:127"/>Laws of the Nation, which puts me in mind of ſome old ways of Government in theſe things; <hi>viz.</hi> Any Man that was found to be Drunk, the <hi>Gunner</hi> had a certain Shoulder-Belt, kept for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and he was to wear it, until there was another found in the ſame fault, who ſhould take it off him; but it was not at all peſting, for if he wore it often, and much, it was a blot to his Reputation, and a clog to his Preferment: Alſo a Swearer, when taken, had a Ridiculous Cap, which was his lot to wear, till he caught another in the ſame fault: Alſo for a Lyer, there was found one or two who had told Lyes, and on proof, they were hoiſted up on the main Stay, with Brooms, Buckets, and Shovels tyed to them, and all the Ships Company crying out, <hi>A Lyer, a Lyer,</hi> &amp;c. and for that fault they were to Swab, and make clean ſuch parts of the Decks all that Week, or until others were found; but if the Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:47039:128"/>now were to wear the Cap, or the Drunkard the Belt, where Swearing is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed moſt by the Officers, beginning from the <hi>Captain,</hi> to the <hi>Cook,</hi> and Men, from the <hi>Midſhipman,</hi> to the <hi>Swobber;</hi> Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, unclean and filthy talk of Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, boaſted of openly before the Ships Company, and by the Officers, and as well allowed of; nay, better than a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Temperate, Honeſt, and good Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour. Now if any of theſe Practices are in any of Their Ships, I know, and am ſorry to ſpeak it, That for many Years paſt, that not only the <hi>Navy,</hi> but the Nation in general, hath had a vein of Debauchery running through it at a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious rate, not one Vice only, but all Vices, from the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s Vice, to the <hi>Pariſh Prieſt;</hi> from the <hi>Peer,</hi> to the <hi>Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant:</hi> And all theſe Abominations were brought amongſt us, by like Pollicies, as the <hi>Moabites</hi> did to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by the Advice of <hi>Balam,</hi> to commit wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:47039:128"/>with their Women, and anger the Lord; ſo was this no leſs a deſign con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived at <hi>Rome,</hi> That finding they could not ſhake the <hi>Church of England,</hi> by dint of Argument, nor undermine it by ſecret maintaining of Hereſies and Schiſms with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her Bowels; this third Project of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam</hi> is tried, with the pleaſures of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, of the moſt flagitious and ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt Nature; nay, both Prince and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, that Religion was as little practiſed, as meant, in any Matters; nay, it was rather a Subject for Ridicule: This did go near, and bid for the Mark, having effeminated, and deſtroyed the Proweſs, good Methods, and Government of our Armies, by Sea, and Land, and ſhook even the Pillars of the Church. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I think, it may be high time to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a Remedy to this foul Diſeaſe, inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated, and diſperſed as well into the <hi>Navy,</hi> as Land, that the Nation do not lie under God's Interdict, for their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:47039:129"/>Pollutions ſpoken of; for <hi>Iſrael</hi> had a ſmart Scourge ſent them, for being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with <hi>Balam</hi>'s Device: So hoping as well the <hi>Navy,</hi> as the <hi>Land,</hi> may re-aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume their Priſtine Order, Government, and Innocence, and then may we hope God's Judgments may be averted for what is paſt.</p>

               <p>THE <hi>Navy,</hi> as I have ſaid before, by which we muſt gain, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our antient Rights of the Dominion of the <hi>Narrow Seas,</hi> &amp;c. will require a ſetled Pollicy; as for the Government thereof; ſo alſo for the Breeding, and Maintaining of <hi>Marriners,</hi> and <hi>maritime People,</hi> ſuch a Pollicy, as ſhall produce a ſufficient number of the product of the People of the Nation, by a kind of willing
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:47039:134"/>Conſtraint, to addict themſelves to <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time Lives;</hi> I ſay, ſufficient for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of our Power at Sea; and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the places at all times of thoſe that the Wars and Accidents thereof, ſhall from time to time conſume.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The <hi>Cheſt,</hi> being an old Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Pollicy deviſed, and enacted in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whoſe Memory may never be forgotten in this Land; not only for ſetling and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Proteſtant Religion;</hi> but by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Nation into ſuch a poſture of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Defence both by Sea and Land; by building of <hi>Ships, Docks, Forts, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> &amp;c. and providing of <hi>Artillery</hi> and <hi>Munitions</hi> for War, that this Land hath not only defended themſelves againſt the ſhocks of War, made by moſt of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Princes, upon it, abroad: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the often Rebellions in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Jars of <hi>Scotland,</hi> near two third parts of the now <hi>Britiſh</hi> Dominions, giving her
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:47039:134"/>continual Diverſions at home; yet by the Divine Aſſiſtance, with good Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, Publick, and Heroick Spirited, Juſt, and Wiſe Leaders, and Commanders, and a Conſentaneous, Agreeable Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all her Subjects together, for the end deſired, <hi>viz.</hi> To maintain their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, Religion, and Laws from being Conquered, or Impoſed upon by any, or all the Princes of <hi>Europe;</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were deſtitute of Allies to aſſiſt them; but on the contrary, gave often Aſſiſtance, and Succours to the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French Proteſtants:</hi> I ſay, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all theſe great Rubs, ſhe defended this Iſland, not only from any great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits done on her; but ſcoured the Seas, and carried the War into her Enemies Countries, to her eternal Fame, and their no leſs Shame: The Particulars of which are eaſily gathered out of the Hiſtories of her Life, and the Monuments of her; as, <hi>Caſtles, Forts, Ships, Artillery,</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:47039:135"/>Proviſions</hi> remaining, with us, to this day, will witneſs; the Memory of whom, and the Actions of whoſe days, I cannot let paſs, without mentioning: <hi>viz.</hi> She came to the Crown in a time when the Nation was freſh bleeding of the Wounds given them by their moſt cruel, and bloody Enemies; beſide which Wounds, it was inwardly ſick of <hi>Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents;</hi> and the Extream Parts, <hi>viz. Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſo gangren'd, that it had been more happy for her, they had not been: At which time, I ſay, God gave them a Soveraign, that with his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Aſſiſtance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> bound up their Wounds, and healed their Sickneſs in Church and State; in compariſon of which Time and Opportunity, I think it very proper to bring in our Soveraigns; yet, I hope, not from a Temper of an ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boding Prophet, to forewarn us, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for ſome long time of <hi>Maritime Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,</hi> believing, That before the Seas
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:47039:135"/>will be again ſetled in Peace, there may be many hard Tugs, but between what Nations, I gueſs not: But, I ſay, that both the <hi>Dane,</hi> and <hi>Swede</hi> are Arming to put in their Sickles for a Harveſt; beſide <hi>Dutch, French, Spaniard,</hi> and <hi>Portugues.</hi> As in a Brawl, Riot, or Breach of the Peace, whoſoever pretends to preſerve the Peace of that place, or would preſerve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and have a Rule and Dominion there, he ought to be of greater ſtrength than the Rioters, or elſe he were better to hold his Peace, and keep farther off, leſt the ſaid Rioters ſhall do, as I have known, in divers Frays; many have joined upon one, whoſe deſign was only to part them: Wherefore, I ſay, we pretending a Right and Dominion in the <hi>Narrow Seas;</hi> and being, by God Almighty, ſo advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oufly ſeated, as if he intended our Iſland to be the Husband of theſe <hi>Northern</hi> and <hi>Weſtern</hi> Seas, from the <hi>Baltick,</hi> to <hi>Cape-Finiſter,</hi> and by a properer Dominion,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:47039:136"/>and Right to be Married to her every Year, than the <hi>Venetian</hi> has to be Married to the <hi>Gulf of Venice,</hi> and thoſe Seas, as they are in ſolemn manner; the which Miſtreſs, if we neglect to pay our due Viſits, and ſuffer her to be Careſſed, or evil entreated by others, we may loſe her Affection, and ever after may Court her in vain for a Smile, to our eternal loſs, and ſhame, and not to be too ſparing of our Monies in Treating her, like the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinopolitans,</hi> when the <hi>Turk</hi> Beſieged it; the Emperour went about praying them to ſpare him Money to pay his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to defend it; who excuſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they had it not: But when the <hi>Turk</hi> took it, he found enough to pay his Men therewith.</p>
               <p>It is high time now to return to the <hi>Cheſt,</hi> ſetled in the ſaid Queens Reign: which is, That every Warrant Officer, and Sea-man, in the Service, has deduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of his Pay, Six-pence <hi>per</hi> Month,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:47039:136"/>by the <hi>Pay-maſter</hi> of the <hi>Navy,</hi> who pays the ſame to ſo many, <hi>viz. Purſers, Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwains,</hi> and <hi>Gunners,</hi> (of the Firſt Rates, commonly,) in all, I think, five, who are new choſen yearly, and are called Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of the <hi>Cheſt;</hi> who have their Annual Meetings, to adjuſt their Accounts with their Receiver, or <hi>Clerk;</hi> and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the Gratuities they allow for Smart-Money, what they ſhall think good to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a Man either at that inſtant, and an Annual Penſion during life, or according to his Wound, or Loſs, only to give him a Sumn, and no Penſion: I ſay, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Money is called Smart-Money, and the other a Penſion. Now they are a <hi>Corporation</hi> by Act of Parliament, with power to buy or ſell Land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They have alſo, a <hi>Superviſor,</hi> who is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly a <hi>Commiſſioner</hi> of the <hi>Navy:</hi> And moreover, the <hi>Lord High Admiral,</hi> or <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> of the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> hath a Superſeding Power over them; an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:47039:137"/>Pollicy; for if a Man loſes a Limb, he receives ſix Pounds thirteen Shillings four Pence Yearly, for his Life, and one Year at entrance, for Smart-Money: The whole Man, that hath paid his Six-pences all his Life, and never received any, may bleſs God that he never came under that Circumſtance; and he that does, may alſo bleſs God for raiſing the ſaid Queens Heart to make that Proviſion for him to ſupport his Needs. I have not a mind to find Fault with the Management, nor have I heard much cauſe for it; but I do not admire the giving of Salaries to <hi>Chirurgeons</hi> abroad, to certifie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereas the Parties aggrieved, would find of the Officers that are Witneſſes of the Chance, enough to let them know the truth thereof, and not Perſons intereſted in their Cure a Shoar, and never ſaw the Miſchance. I will ſay no more, but thus, That the beſt Conſtituted Pollicies that ever yet were in the World; nay, go ſo
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:47039:137"/>high as God's Church, they are Humane, and Servants, or rather Subjects to time, which corrupts, and ruſts the moſt dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things; and therefore, for its perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, it muſt undergo ſome time of cleanſing away the Corruptions; after which, it may re-aſſume its priſtine Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and Beauty. So, I ſay, if the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi> may undergo a cleanſing, and ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo may this alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> of the right Chanels in the firſt Act and Inſtitution thereof, and pare off all evil, by Orders, or by Conſtitutions crept in as by Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of Wages, and Sallaries to <hi>Receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Pay-maſters, Clerks, Chyrurgeens,</hi> &amp;c. Sale of Lands, and Rents, and make due E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, and alſo for due accounting with the <hi>Pay-maſter:</hi> Although I accuſe not, yet it is not to be doubted, That Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions have not failed to be here alſo; and therefore, I do heartily recommend it to the Inſpection of the <hi>Superviſors,</hi> and Viſitors of the ſame: And for an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:47039:138"/>of the Revenue, That whereas of late Years, the Ships of ſmall Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſeldom have Chaplains to ſupply the place, that thoſe Groats are ordered for the <hi>Cheſt:</hi> I confeſs, for ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that Money was begged of the King, by ſome <hi>Navy</hi> Officers; I think, as odd a ſort of Requeſt, as Gift, to beg the Money ſtopt out of Mens Pay, to enrich them; but now it goes to the <hi>Cheſt</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Limbleſs, and Maimed Sailer, from whom it is taken.</p>
               <p>I ſay no more, but that if the Ships, which are fitted out only for the Chanel, had no Chaplains put on Board them, ſave ſome in the Flags, and only the Allowance of the Chaplains Eighteen Shillings <hi>per</hi> Month, be given to one, whom the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or majority of Officers ſhall chuſe to read Prayers, and do the Offices for the Dead; the ſaid Eighteen Shillings <hi>per</hi> Month, added to his other Pay, would be a ſufficient Recompence for the ſame;
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:47039:138"/>but any that goes out of the Chanel, ſhould have Chaplains, and they able, as I ſaid before: But in the Chanel, there is the greateſt Ships, and moſt Money gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven away, and for the leaſt purpoſe, for very ſeldom have they Opportunities for other than Prayers, and that rarely, for they are either coming in, or going out, heaving, working, or coming to Anchor, or bad Weather in the Chanel; ſo that I ſay, the uſe of ſuch Miſſions ſerves to a very little purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to inſtruct Men to a Godly Life: For the Prayers, I ſpake before of, would amount to as much, and many poor maimed Men be relieved with the ſame; the which is no ſmall Sums in the great Ships, which are in the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel; but when Ships are to go on a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Voyage, they ſhould never go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out able Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> To Provide for the Poor Male Children of the Nation, That is, a great part of the product of the People of the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:47039:139"/>Nation are poor People, who are not able to provide for the Fruit of their own Bodies; ſo that in the Reign of the ſaid good Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> was deviſed, and enacted a Law for an equal Tax to be raiſed from all Eſtates, Perſonal, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, for the Relief of the Poor; and therein preſcribed a Method to keep the Poor on work, to avoid their being idle and uſeleſs in the State, that they might not live in Idleneſs, and Looſeneſs at the charge of their Neighbours, which part of the Law took ſo little effect, that no <hi>Workhouſes</hi> were uſed out of a general pity to the Poor, which made that defect; ſo that of that Act, only one part took ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, <hi>viz.</hi> the poor were provided for in their Wants, which fell upon them by Converting the Lands of the Monaſticks, and Recluſes, into Lay Poſſeſſions, on which depended great numbers of People, Poor, and Idle; but for that part which was to provide for their Idleneſs, that
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:47039:139"/>they might not live uſeleſs, and burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Members of the State, took, I ſay, no effect; but that they, and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren alſo, bred up in the ſaid Idle Life, are generally Heirs of their Parents Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verties; by which they are conſtant ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of their Neighbours Eſtates, and Labours, and are of no more uſe to the State, than by their generally fruitful Procreations, and ſerve to people the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; of which there is great want, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Situation, Product, and Manufact thereof, ſufficient to afford Maintainance, and Employment for five times the number; and eſpecially upon the Seas, to Employ five times the number, which would Employ, and Maintain ten times the number on the Land.</p>
               <p>Now that there might be a kind of willing Conſtraint (if I may ſay ſo) on the People, to addict themſelves to <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time Lives,</hi> which might produce the effect of producing <hi>Seamen,</hi> and encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:47039:140"/>our <hi>Maritime</hi> ſtrength: If there were a Law enacted, that every <hi>poor Boy</hi> of a Parent, that receives Alms from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, ſhall, at the Age of Fourteen Years, be brought to the Sheriff of every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with an Indenture made by a Juſtice of Peace, and Bound to the King, until he comes to the Age of Twenty four Years, as the former Law directs; which Sheriff ſhall cauſe a Paſs to be made, and convey them from Pariſh to Pariſh, at the Countrys Charges, to <hi>London,</hi> to a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Hoſpital, <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> the great new Houſe that ſtands void there, it might ſoon be fitted into an excellent ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Hoſpital; where ſhould be Officers appointed to keep them, <hi>viz.</hi> a Superan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated <hi>Captain,</hi> to Command the Houſe, a <hi>Purſer,</hi> to Victual them, with Petty-Warrants from the <hi>Victualling-Office;</hi> a <hi>Boatſwain, Gunner,</hi> and <hi>Carpenter,</hi> all Superannuated Officers; each to take a Squadron of them under their care, to
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:47039:140"/>go with them, and Employ them in the Yard at <hi>Deptford,</hi> to ſerve the <hi>Caulkers,</hi> and ſuch Work as <hi>Boys</hi> may do; and to have <hi>Junke</hi> to the Houſe, and pick <hi>Oakam</hi> there, and dry it ready for all the Yards; and ſome of them that are fit to be taught, there, to Write, and Read, and learn <hi>Navigation;</hi> to be divided, and ordered into Squadrons, by the ſaid <hi>Captain,</hi> and lodged in Beds, and Hammocks, as if on Board; and alſo, at every one of the <hi>King's-Yards,</hi> let there be a proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hoſpital provided to keep a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent number of them, to be ſent from the general Hoſpital from time to time, as they ſhall diſpoſe of them, <hi>viz.</hi> all the King's Officers Warranted, that have Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants allowed them, if there be Servants in theſe Hoſpitals, ſhould take of them; to be Turn'd-over, with their Indentures, and bound to them by the <hi>Commiſſioner</hi> of the place, who ſhall ſerve them in the full of their Indenture made to the <hi>King;</hi>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:47039:141"/>alſo at the general Hoſpital, ſhould be a <hi>Commiſſioner</hi> of the <hi>Navy,</hi> whoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Station ſhall be to Overſee the ſame, and by his Clerk enter all the Names in a general <hi>Entry-Book,</hi> and diſpoſe them to their Places, Yards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> keeping a fair <hi>Ledger</hi> of their Names, Places, Whence, Time, Whither Diſpoſed, and When; and alſo ſhall at their <hi>Matriculation,</hi> or Entrance, cauſe on one of their Arms to be made a Mark in the Skin, with Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that may never be gotten out, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>K,</hi> or what other Letter may be thought good, to ſignifie whoſe Servants they are, in caſe they ſhould deſert their Service; that it ſhould be a damage ſufficient to any one that entertains them, to deter them from it.</p>
               <p>I do herein but mark out the rough Lines of the Projection, which muſt be amply Poliſhed by the Act of Parliament, and by the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> to methodize it: It would be too tedious for me here; beſide,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:47039:141"/>it would be Preſumption in me, to light a Candle to the Sun.</p>
               <p>I will only hint a few things neceſſary thereto, <hi>viz.</hi> if ſuch Orders were, That no <hi>Merchant Ship</hi> ſhall go to Sea, but ſhall receive of the ſaid <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner,</hi> to every Six or Ten Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons the Ship ſhall carry, one of theſe <hi>Boys;</hi> they to bring their Certificate for their clearing, as from the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe,</hi> ſo from the <hi>Commiſſioner</hi> of this Affair; and at their return, to give the ſaid <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner</hi> an Account of what is become of the <hi>Boys,</hi> and return them, and pay, or Account with the <hi>Commiſſioner</hi> for the time they had ſerved them, at the rate of ſo many Shillings <hi>per</hi> Month, as they are Years old; and if the <hi>Commiſſioner,</hi> and <hi>Maſter</hi> does agree, then he to take him for the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Term;</hi> or elſe the <hi>Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner,</hi> upon the receipt of his Wages, out of which he is to allow for Cloaths, in the Voyage, not exceeding Five Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:47039:142"/>
                  <hi>per</hi> Month, to order him elſewhere; Cloathing him with the remainder, and diſpoſe of him without further Charge to the <hi>King,</hi> if poſſible: So that after the time he is ſo put abroad, whatſoever Money he clears at his return, he muſt have an <hi>Account, Debtor,</hi> and <hi>Creditor,</hi> kept for him; ſo that he muſt either clear ſo much, as the <hi>King</hi> hath been at Charges with him, at five Pence <hi>per diem,</hi> which Account he muſt clear, before he receives a Certificate from the ſaid <hi>Commiſſioner,</hi> that he is Manumiſed, or cleared the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: And in the mean time, if he ſerves any other Maſter, and produces not the ſaid Certificate of his Manumiſement, the ſaid Maſter is chargeable with the ſaid Wages, all, except ſo much as he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in Cloaths, which muſt not exceed five Shillings <hi>per</hi> Month; and what he ſhall have gained beyond his Charges, ſhould alſo be juſtly paid him at his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numiſement, Moreover, all the <hi>King</hi>'s
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:47039:142"/>
                  <hi>Officers</hi> that ſhall take them for the whole Term, ſhould pay for one <hi>Boy</hi> Ten Pounds, and receive them at Sixteen Years Old; which Moneys ſhould be ſtopt out of his Pay; for every one that wants Servants, hath not Ten Pounds to lay down, which Servants ſhall be paid Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges by the <hi>King,</hi> to his <hi>Maſter,</hi> for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Year they ſhall ſerve of the Indenture, ſo many Shillings <hi>per</hi> Month, as they are Years Old; which Servants will be better to the Officers, than ſuch as they can get themſelves; for they never need fear the running away of them; if they run, they are to be found eaſily, by their <hi>Marks,</hi> that they cannot deceive any one that Entertains them; the ſaid Officers having the ſame Right to gain them again with their Wages, for their abſent time, as the <hi>King</hi> hath for ſuch as he puts abroad to <hi>Merchant-men:</hi> The ſame Privileges to all <hi>Carpenters, Caulkers, Rope-makers,</hi> &amp;c. that ſhall take any of them: So that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:47039:143"/>one will covet to take the King's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, for the certainty of them; and they well conſequently prove better Servants, knowing they cannot ſhift their Services: And alſo there ſhould be a Reſpect had to them in the Service, during their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentures, by the <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> to ſee them not wronged by their Maſters: And alſo at the end of their Indentures, or before, according to their Deſerts, they ſhould be preferred.</p>
               <p>Now every Pariſh that hath not one <hi>Boy,</hi> to ſend to the <hi>King,</hi> ſhould be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the next adjacent Pariſh, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of their <hi>Poor,</hi> who ſends above two <hi>Boys</hi> Yearly, as aforeſaid; this to be done by the Juſtices of the Peace, in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Diviſions, and every Overſeer, and Church-warden of every Pariſh, ſhall at every petty Seſſions, at one ſet time in the Year, produce, to the ſaid Juſtices, a Recept from the Sheriff, of the <hi>Boys</hi> delivered the Year paſt, with the Names,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:47039:143"/>and Ages of the ſaid <hi>Boys;</hi> and alſo, the ſaid Sheriff ſhall, at the paſſing his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts for his Year, deliver into the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, a true Roll, or Liſt, in Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of the <hi>Boys</hi> ſent that Year, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Age, Name, and Place of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode, of the ſaid <hi>Boys;</hi> and when, and whither ſent, with the <hi>Commiſſioner</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt for them, which ſhould be tranſact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by a Poſt Letter of Advice to the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner,</hi> when he ſends, which ſhould be anſwered by the <hi>Commiſſioner,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther received, or not.</p>
               <p>In the ſaid Roll, given into the <hi>Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,</hi> their Names ſhould be ſet Alphabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically, for eaſie finding them; which ſhould be there filled up, and kept ſafe, to be examined by any one that ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after any <hi>Boy, viz.</hi> their Parents, Relations, Friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who may have liberty to redeem them out of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, paying ſo much for every Year the King has been at Charges with them, by Methods ordered; for ſome may have E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:47039:144"/>fallen to them, or Parents: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, once every Year, the <hi>Commiſſioner</hi> at the <hi>General Hoſpital,</hi> ſhall by his Clerk, tranſmit into the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> a fair <hi>Ledger Book</hi> of all the <hi>Boys</hi> entred, and ſent out that Year, from whence received, and to whom bound out; that a good Account may be had thereof, when deſired: Alſo the Juſtices of the Peace, at the Binding the <hi>Boys</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> ſhould take care, that he binds none that are not ſound in Body; and for his guidance therein, ſhould receive a Preſentment, ſigned by the <hi>Miniſter, Church-wardens,</hi> and <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers of the Poor</hi> of that Pariſh, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Age, Name, and place of Abode, and ſoundneſs of Body and Limbs of the ſaid <hi>Boy,</hi> and that they deſire may be received into the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Service,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſaid Act; and if it may be, let the Parent, if alive, or neareſt of Kin, ſign it alſo. I ſay, I do only hint the matter, and will hereto add, That the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:47039:144"/>Benefits hereby, would be in a greater degree than I can ſet forth, and be of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle purpoſe to endeavour; it would only ſerve to lengthen my Diſcourſe, and yet come ſhort of every Intelligent Man's Reaſons, which they may collect out of their more large <hi>Speculations.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I only affirm, That within Ten, nay Seven Years, would be added to our <hi>Naval Strength</hi> many Thouſands of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>able Mariners,</hi> and <hi>Artificers,</hi> and would be an ever-living <hi>Seminary</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and for their conſtant Employment, both in <hi>War,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> I ſhall (God willing) ſhew in the Sequel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, The Encouragement of</hi> Fiſhery.</p>
               <p>By the <hi>Fiſhery,</hi> I underſtand, this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had thier firſt introduction to their <hi>Maritime Growth,</hi> and together with their large <hi>Drapery,</hi> or <hi>Wollen Manufactures,</hi> not omitting their Acquiſitions by Trade
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:47039:145"/>in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and alſo the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> all which, and eſpecially the former, and the latter, are now ſuffering under a very great declenſion. As for the latter, I can ſay little as yet; but the former I will ſay it is in our power yet to regain by theſe means following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That a great reaſon of our decay of <hi>Fiſhery,</hi> is our laying aſide the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Lent,</hi> upon the Account of a Religious Obſervation; the which, I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to be a general miſtake; for the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution thereof was never in <hi>England,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any other than a Pollitick Account; although the Church, according to the Primitive Examples, hath adviſed all in her Community, to keep ſome certain Days in the Week of Abſtinence, from the more liberal Feeding, for the eaſier ſubduing of Carnal Concupiſcence, and caſting up their Errors of the Week, and chiefly on <hi>Friday,</hi> the Day of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Suffering; ſo once in the Year, for
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:47039:145"/>the whole Years Account, and according unto Primitive Inſtitution, and in Imitation, or Example of our Saviour's Forty Days Abſtinence in the Wilderneſs, ſetting it at the time of the Year in preparation to the Celebrating the Commemoration of that great Work of our Saviour's, <hi>The Redemption of Mankind,</hi> at the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> or <hi>Paſchal-Feaſt</hi> of the <hi>Jews;</hi> ſo with us, the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> at which time ſhe adviſes all her Diſciples, to receive the <hi>Holy Communion,</hi> in a more <hi>Particular,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Communion,</hi> and <hi>Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi> and Invites, at that time eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>Catechumene,</hi> or <hi>Younger Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> to enter into the ſaid <hi>Communion:</hi> yet notwithſtanding, I ſay, I do not find by the Conſtitutions of the <hi>Engliſh Church,</hi> that ſhe denounces any <hi>Judgments,</hi> or <hi>Excommunications,</hi> for the non-obſervance of the ſaid <hi>Lent,</hi> or Days of Abſtinence; but by way of Requeſt, and Advice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, for their better preparation for
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:47039:146"/>the receiving that moſt <hi>Holy Sacrament;</hi> but he which thinks it no means towards it, may not obſerve it, but may be under a miſtake; and he which thinks it may be a means, may obſerve it, and may be in the right: Yet to learn of the Apoſtle, <hi>Him that eateth not, not to deſpiſe him that eateth; and him that abſtaineth not, not to deſpiſe him that abſtaineth:</hi> But, I hope, no Religious Man will deny, but that Days of Abſtinence, and general Publick Faſts, are uſeful Preparations to Holy Duties; yet ſo I take it, That it is the Civil Pollicy of the Nation that enjoyned the keeping of <hi>Lent,</hi> upon the Account of encouraging the Trade of <hi>Fiſhery,</hi> to advance the <hi>Naval Strength,</hi> in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing of <hi>Maritime People</hi> for the taking it, and the ſupporting of <hi>Navigation,</hi> and promoting of Foreign Trade, by the Tranſporting it abroad into other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys, where it is acceptable, and for the encreaſe of <hi>Cattle, Fowl,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:47039:146"/>
               <p>Now the common Objections, are theſe two:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That it is the Relicks of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Superſtition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is Anſwered already, That the <hi>Church</hi> makes no neceſſity for the <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Obſervation</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>The Second is, That our plenty of Fleſh requires no preſervation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer, That the Seaſon of the Year is ſuch, that there is not ſo great plenty of Fleſh at that time of the Year, as at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others, which Fleſh generally is Calves and Lambs, who if they were more ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly ſlain for thoſe few Days, after which they would be more mature, and better Meat, and ſome more would eſcape the Slaughter, and befor Breed; and inſtead thereof we ſhould feed, in ſome of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim on Fiſh, which would be Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Maintainance of <hi>Fiſhermen,</hi> and <hi>Seamen;</hi> who are themſelves to be fed all the reſt of the Year, by their Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:47039:147"/>for their other Voyages from the Land, which would take up far greater Quantities of the Product of the Nation, <hi>viz. Mault, Beefs, Mutton, Bread, But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Cheeſe,</hi> and <hi>Peaſe, Oat-meal, and all manner of Cloathing;</hi> for one of theſe at Sea, ſpends thrice the value of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Products, with Manufacts of Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Ship, and Tackle, than a <hi>Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> or <hi>Husband-man</hi> doth; and, I ſay, be a far more Conſumption of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and Manufact of the Nation, than the ſlaying for thoſe few Days will cauſe. And moreover, be the anſwering the main end now in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> The increaſing of our <hi>Maritime Strength,</hi> and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Navigation,</hi> for the more large Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of our Manufacts, to our great enriching, and ſecurity from our Enemys abroad, and to the every way procuring the Strength, Wealth, and Happineſs of the Nation: To which, if it were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, might be added a great deal more, to
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:47039:147"/>Invite the practice thereof, againſt thoſe groundleſs Exceptions of debaſing the price of Lands; but it is ſufficiently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, in the forgoing, to all reaſonable Men: Therefore I only add this one, That we ſhould be capable to fill the <hi>Empories</hi> abroad, with the product of our <hi>Seas,</hi> and graſp a better part of the <hi>Foreign Trade,</hi> which, of late Years, hath been graſped from us, which may prove to our Enlargement, and a ſtop to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; the which is a more juſtifiable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, before <hi>God,</hi> than <hi>Arms;</hi> and more ſuitable to the practice of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in the <hi>Goſpel, who managed his Ten Talents, to the gaining of Ten more;</hi> which intituled him to the <hi>Euge bone,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As for the <hi>Merchants Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,</hi> for the advance of <hi>Sea-men,</hi> and to avoid the great Trouble, Charges, and Abuſes in <hi>Preſſing of Men,</hi> which hath ſo little effect; I have ſaid ſomething
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:47039:148"/>already in their carrying of the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Boys.</hi> Now if all <hi>Merchant-men,</hi> who are bound to any Foreign Parts, ſhould at their clearing, at the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe,</hi> leave a Liſt of their <hi>Ships Company,</hi> containing the true <hi>Names,</hi> and <hi>Sir-names,</hi> and <hi>pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their uſual Reſidence, Ages,</hi> &amp;c. of the <hi>Maſter,</hi> and <hi>Ships Company,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bound, and when cleared the <hi>Cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe;</hi> and alſo at their entrance of the <hi>Ships</hi> into the <hi>Custom-houſe</hi> upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns, a like Book, or Liſt of what Men ſhe brought home with her, and Signed by the <hi>Maſter;</hi> which Books ſhall be ſent by the <hi>General Cuſtom-houſe Meſſenger,</hi> every Week, unto the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> where ſhould be an expert Clerk, in a particular Office, only for that purpoſe, to receive the ſame; and out of the ſaid Liſts, to enter into Books, he ſhould keep for that purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> an Alphabet of Books, a Book for each Letter Yearly; or perhaps Twenty Books, may contain the Twenty
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:47039:148"/>four Letters, ſome Letters being not ſo much uſed, that a Book may contain two or three, all ruled with Columns, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Maſter, Ship,</hi> and <hi>Companies Names, Places of uſual Reſidence, whence Come, whither Bound, when Entred, Inward, and Outward,</hi> &amp;c. And alſo, that the <hi>Vice-Admiral</hi> of every County, do by himſelf, or ſufficient <hi>Deputy,</hi> every Year, or as often as the <hi>Lord High Admiral</hi> ſhall direct, Viſit all the <hi>Sea Ports, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> and <hi>Creeks</hi> of every Pariſh, and place where <hi>Maritime People</hi> Inhabit; as <hi>Seamen, Fiſhermen, Hoymen, Ferrymen, Bargemen,</hi> &amp;c. within their ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and there ſhall ſend for, or ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon before them, the <hi>Church-wardens,</hi> and <hi>Overſeers of the Poor,</hi> who ſhall give them account of what ſuch Men live within their Precincts, their <hi>true Names, Sir-names, Ages,</hi> and <hi>Aboads;</hi> which ſaid Accounts ſhall, by the ſaid <hi>Vice-Admiral,</hi> be drawn into a fair Liſt, and ſent unto
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:47039:149"/>the ſaid Office, and there be entred into the ſaid Books. Now the <hi>Vice-Admiral</hi> might, by his Warrant, ſend to the ſaid Pariſhes, to ſend in to him, by ſuch a day appointed, at a moſt convenient place for their eaſe, the ſaid Account; and in caſe any ſhall neglect the ſaid Duty, or Conceal any Man that hath uſed the ſaid Practice, and place, for the ſpace of Six Months, from between the Ages of Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, and Sixty, that are not worth one Hundred Pounds clear, when Debts paid, or in ſuch ſort as the <hi>Lord High Admiral</hi> ſhall direct his Warrant to the <hi>Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral;</hi> the Nature, and Subſtance of the <hi>Vice-Admirals</hi> to contain the ſubſtance of the <hi>High-Admirals;</hi> which Returns, or Preſentments, leaſt they prove to be falſe by Concealments, and Partialities, they ſhould be required upon Oath: After which, if the ſaid <hi>Vice-Admiral</hi> ſhall upon his Viſits find falſe, or partial, he ſhould ſend to the <hi>Quarter Seſſions</hi> next, his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:47039:149"/>of that Officer's Perjury, under Hand and Seal, to the <hi>Clerk of the Peace,</hi> who ſhould file the ſaid Information a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that <hi>Church-warden,</hi> or <hi>Overſeer of the Poor,</hi> and proceed againſt him, in behalf of the <hi>King,</hi> as for <hi>Perjury,</hi> and puniſhed by the Judgment of the <hi>Bench.</hi> If the Laws extant, are not ſufficient to impower the <hi>Lord High Admiral</hi> to do theſe things, as here mentioned, there might be a Clauſe added to his Power, as the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhall think meet, for the better governing of the <hi>Maritime</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; by which Methods aforeſaid, being duly obſerved, and kept, it would coſt the <hi>King</hi> for keeping the ſaid Office, but a ſmall matter, which would ſoon be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, in the great Expences for <hi>Preſſing of Men;</hi> beſide the great Abuſes done in the Countrys, be prevented, if the <hi>Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals</hi> be good Men. Alſo, if the ſaid Law were, That if any Pariſh ſhall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal any one between the ſaid <hi>Seſſions,</hi>
                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:47039:150"/>and ſummoned, and not bring him forth, That for every Man ſo Concealed, and proved by the Oath of one Man, That he was in the Pariſh, by the ſpace of Twenty four Hours, and not ſeized by any of the Pariſh, then the <hi>Vice-Admiral</hi>'s <hi>Deputy,</hi> ſhall take Diſtreſs upon the ſaid <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens,</hi> or <hi>Overſeers of the Poor,</hi> for Ten Shillings for every ſuch Man, and for every time ſo Concealed, to be born by the <hi>Pariſh</hi> equally, out of the <hi>Pariſh</hi> Rates.</p>
               <p>I only add, That if the <hi>Lord High Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral</hi>'s Warrants to all the <hi>High Sheriffs</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that they do ſend their War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants to the <hi>Conſtables of Hundreds, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentakes,</hi> &amp;c. and they to the <hi>Petty-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables,</hi> or <hi>Tything-men,</hi> That they ſhould make a like Preſentment, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Conſtable of the Hundred,</hi> ſhould deliver it in every <hi>Aſſizes,</hi> or <hi>Goal-delivery;</hi> which Preſentment the <hi>Petty-Conſtables</hi> ſhould be ſworn to the truth thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:47039:150"/>ſome <hi>Juſtice of the Peace,</hi> before the <hi>High Conſtable</hi> receiveth it, and then he ſhould from thence draw one Preſentment for the <hi>Hundred,</hi> to give in at the Aſſizes; and ſay, as from the <hi>Petty-Conſtables,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Oaths, thus preſenteth; out of which Preſentments, the <hi>Clerk of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſizes</hi> ſhall give the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> the needful Account, at the end of every Circuit, there to be entered into the Office afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid: For many Men, when War is, do betake themſelves to live with their Friends in the <hi>Inlands,</hi> and follow their <hi>Occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and at the end of the Wars, do return to their <hi>Maritime Lives,</hi> or wait to make ſlips into <hi>Merchant-men;</hi> but this being duly executed by <hi>Vice-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, Cuſtom-houſes,</hi> and <hi>High-Sheriffs,</hi> and trinſmitted unto ſuch an Office, as before mentioned, and there well digeſted into Method, and duly kept; ſo it would enable the <hi>Lord High Admiral,</hi> at all times, to give the <hi>King,</hi> his <hi>Council,</hi> and
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:47039:151"/>
                  <hi>Parliament,</hi> when required, a true, and certain ſtate of the Kingdom, as to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime Strength;</hi> and alſo enable him to collect them from all Places, in little Time; leſs Charges, and leſs Trouble to the People, in their Diſquiet of the Country: So there might be made good Eſtimates of the Increaſe or Decreaſe of our <hi>Maritime Strength;</hi> at any time to be gathered out of the <hi>Ledger-Books</hi> of the ſaid Office, and only Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the <hi>Admiralty;</hi> and yet farther, at the <hi>King's,</hi> or perhaps the <hi>Lord High Admiral</hi>'s Order, Proclamation might be made upon the <hi>Exchange,</hi> or put out in <hi>Gazattes,</hi> Requiring all Merchants, Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Ships, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to ſignifie by their Letter to the ſaid Office where their Ships were, by their laſt Advices, and whither Bound, and where expected next, with ſome Eſtimate of the Ships number of Men, Burthen, and ſome value of Cargo; that care proportionably might be taken, for
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:47039:151"/>their Protection, and Preſervation; the which may often prevent the ſudden Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Subjects, and Wealthy Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Nation; for it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that <hi>Merchants,</hi> &amp;c. can be privy to the Intrigues of States, which ought to have their Paths in Secret and Select Councils. As for the Methodizing theſe things, I do not project; but only hint the Baſis, and Foundations thereof; that the Superſtructures might be raiſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to perfection, by the Skilful Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors of the Wiſe Legiſlators, and State Politicians of the Nation.</p>

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:47039:153"/>hopes of a large ſhare of the Seas; the which, if longer continued, it would have a bad effect on <hi>England,</hi> I fear; they not only, by their Strength, diſquiet us there, but alſo Countenancing, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing the <hi>Natives</hi> to Arms, ſupplying them therewith, but alſo Aſſiſting, Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Inſtructing, and Supporting them with all Neceſſaries, to diſturb, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy our <hi>Collonies;</hi> whereas, if there were no ſuch Pretenders, that part of the World would be mightily Peopled by us, and be a Trade that would take off a vaſt Manufact from us, and maintain a great <hi>Navigation,</hi> which would be ready to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt us, in our <hi>European Wars,</hi> whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we ſhould be put to it: Nay, in little time, the Trade thereof might be ſo increaſed, that it might take off the greateſt part of our <hi>Woollen Manufacts</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and Products of <hi>Tin, Lead, Iron,</hi> &amp;c. eſpecially if we addict our ſelves alſo to a <hi>Linen Manufact;</hi> the which we

               </p>
               <p>I ſay, Theſe Encreaſes of our <hi>Collonies,</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> would be a mighty ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement to our Trade, by its myſterial way of walk, and make our Bulk of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine Affairs</hi> ſwell to a vaſt Quantity; which is the very <hi>Strength, Glory,</hi> and <hi>Safety</hi> of the Nation, as I have elſewhere ſhewed; and was alſo early perceived by the Excellent Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> in his moſt Elaborate, and Accurate Work, of <hi>the Hiſtory of the World.</hi> I ſay, Theſe things are of a mighty Conſideration to us: So that if we do not timely make uſe of the Talent, that God Almighty hath given us poſſeſſion of already, we may afterwards find it too late; and ſo by ſtep after ſtep, and ſlip after ſlip, let ſlip the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:47039:154"/>laſt opportunity of maintaining our Right, and Dominion of the Seas; the which being gone, the effect thereof may be, to be glad to enjoy the <hi>Collonies,</hi> and <hi>Trade</hi> we have already acquired, and our quiet at home; the which we muſt no longer expect, than that it is according to the Will and Pleaſure of that Nation, who is moſt powerful at Sea; one large ſtep we have made already in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> pray God we are not preparing for another in the <hi>Mediterranean:</hi> The Demoliſhing of <hi>Tangier,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> finds the good Effect thereof, and we the evil. I queſtion, if all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> did not grudge us that place? But it's too late to repine now: Wherefore it becomes us to lay faſt hold of thoſe Opportunities God hath given us, to maintain our <hi>Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> which is, not to let the <hi>French</hi> hold one Command in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> or any part of <hi>America.</hi>

               <p>If any one ſhould ſay, It is not to be done.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer thus, It is much like the luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm, and evil Counſel, given at that time, about <hi>Tangier;</hi> that the coſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to maintain it, was more than the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick Value could be to <hi>England,</hi> and put the <hi>King</hi> to Streights for Money, and often need of his Parliament: The which, when I heard ſpoken, it made me fetch my Breath through my Back for Grief: and Anſwered, <hi>That a Hundred Thouſand Pounds ſpent more, were better than to loſe it:</hi> But I gueſſed it to partake of the <hi>French Polliticks,</hi> as the Selling of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk;</hi> which Town, with <hi>Callice</hi> (which is kept from us, and ſo lately in our Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion) are the next Feathers, moſt need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for <hi>England</hi> to Plume them with, they being more important to us, than a whole Province elſewhere: I will not enter into the Praiſes of them, and the Advantages thereby that would redound to <hi>England,</hi>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:47039:155"/>leſt I ſhould be like the <hi>Hunter,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had caught his Game, took the pains to ſet forth the Excellent Taſtes thereof, and the Ways of Dreſſing it, but never caught it: Wherefore.

                  <hi>Fiſhery,</hi> there ſhould go a <hi>Merchant,</hi> who ſhould be a <hi>Husband</hi> of the <hi>King's Fiſhery,</hi> and give an Account thereof, and be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Admiral</hi>'s Command, and in the Ship with him; who ſhould, by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to the reſt of the <hi>Captains,</hi> give him all convenient aſſiſtance to further the Affair, and go with them up the <hi>Streights</hi> to their Markets, as uſual, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Aſſiſtance and Convoy of more Ships, to make a <hi>Grand Fleet,</hi> to meet at ſuch a place, at ſuch Seaſons as ſhall be appointed for our General, or Grand Convoy; who ſhall Meet, and Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous at ſuch times of the Year, and Place, as hereafter ſhall more particularly be ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Maſters,</hi> and Principal Men of thoſe Captived Ships of the <hi>French,</hi> I ſay, ſhould be put on Board our Men of War, and like Men of Capacity, ſhould be Detached out of the Men of War, and there ſhould they Fiſh, and act
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:47039:156"/>all the Seaſon, for the making of Fiſh for the Publick Stock of the <hi>King</hi>'s; and ſhould have like Encouragement in every reſpect, as the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> if they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to work under the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and at the Determination of the Voyage, at their Arrival in <hi>England,</hi> they ſhould be paid ſuch Wages, as they were to receive in the <hi>French</hi>'s private Owners Service, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man, as they were capacitated by them; and alſo the <hi>Maſters,</hi> for what Shares they can make appear they owned, ſhould be accounted unto them, at their ſaid Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, if they will ſettle here in <hi>England,</hi> and uſe the ſaid Trade; which Concerns of theirs, ſhould remain in the publick Stock, for ſome time, as a Pledge for them, that they do not Deſert when they have it; I mean, till they can give ſome aſſurance of their Fidelity, by getting their Families over, or by going another Voyage; or, ſome way, finding Sureties for their true meaning, otherwiſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:47039:157"/>as Priſoners of War. Now, I mean, there ſhould be three, or five Honeſt good <hi>Merchants</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt-land Company,</hi> who ſhould be Commiſſioned by the King, to manage, and to Husband this Affair of <hi>Fiſhery</hi> for the King: And although the ſaid <hi>Captains</hi> be Commiſſioned, by the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> yet they might be referred to certain Inſtructions, which they ſhould receive from the King's Commiſſioners for <hi>Fiſhery;</hi> and ſuch <hi>Commanders, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi> and <hi>Seamen,</hi> ſhould generally be choſen, who have uſed the Trades, and are the more likely to advance the ſaid Affair by their Knowledge, Diligence, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication; and the difference in their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagements, would in a ſmall time be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and in few Years, advance it to be a conſiderable Affair; and, as I ſaid, the poor <hi>French,</hi> who have been bred up to it, be glad to ſhelter themſelves under our Protection; and every Man ſo gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from our Enemy, may be accounted, in
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:47039:157"/>point of balancing of <hi>Maritime Strength,</hi> at four Men, and ſo proportionably.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to repelling their Strength at Sea, by <hi>Grand Armadoes,</hi> and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſuch an Enemy as will meet us, in a ſet and reſolute point of Battle, as we have been uſed heretofore by others, I conceive, may prove a Miſtake: My Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons therefore are theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That they have now, in their Equipment of this <hi>Fleet,</hi> skimmed, and ſifted their whole Dominion for <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> nay, <hi>Boat-men, Ferry-men,</hi> and all that have uſed the Waters, that there is ſcarce a Man of that Nature, if I may go ſo near, that is left out of the King's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; for they have uſed incredible Art, and Stratagem to bring them out; and they have loſt a conſiderable Number by Sickneſs, ſince their Expedition out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> amongſt which <hi>Iriſh,</hi> they brought much Sickneſs; they have laid by their Merchandize, ſaving a little in the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:47039:158"/>and have alſo drained the <hi>Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:</hi> All this, if my Information be not falſe, (to the truth whereof I muſt refer you,) I ſay, If it be tollerably true, and will Fight us; it beſpakes them rather of that Temper, that a <hi>Marquiſs</hi> of theirs, about Ten Years ſince, was pleaſed to give our Nation a Character in Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule, in a ſmall Tract, called, <hi>The Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks of</hi> France, <hi>preſented unto the</hi> French <hi>King,</hi> but ſoon came into <hi>Engliſh;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſays, <hi>We are a heavy, dull People, fit for ſudden ſtroak, or preſent dint of War, but of no Pollicy to carry it on for any time; and his</hi> Maſter <hi>need not be at any great Expence to make us ruine our ſelves, by our own Expences; let him only cauſe us to Equip, and keep great</hi> Fleets <hi>at Sea; and in the mean time they would prey upon our Merchandize, by the</hi> Knights of Malta, <hi>brought with Privileges into ſome of the Iſlands in</hi> Weſt-France, <hi>we having no Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies;</hi> and ſo goes on.</p>
               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:47039:158"/>
               <p>Now, I ſay, if he fights us with any conſiderable Body of a Fleet; I mean, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively, and plainly to repel Strength with Strength, then I will revert his own Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of us, upon himſelf, and People; <hi>That they are Impolitick, and of no Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to carry on a War of Time, fit only for a ſudden Stroak, or,</hi> Sa, Sa; <hi>their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances being ſuch, That if they fight but Sixty Sail of us, with much more ſtrength, and get the better on't, if we behave our ſelves as we have formerly done, I mean, with good Courage, and Conduct; yet it would be ſo dear a Prize to him, that it were far more prudent for him to let it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; for he has no Stores of</hi> Maſts, Yards, Cordage, Pitch, Tarr, <hi>&amp;c. nor no more</hi> Men, <hi>nor any Allies for either.</hi> So I ſay, That if he be ſo hardy, I declare him without Policy, for then he has done his <hi>Maritime Work</hi> at once, without hopes of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering this Age; whereas, if he does as he did the laſt Year, collect his <hi>Maritime
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:47039:159"/>Strength</hi> together, and Sail a few Leagues to Sea, to Animate his People, or make ſome haſty Expedition into <hi>Ireland,</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> or Depredation on our Coaſt, to fill us, and all the World with Noiſe, and Rumour of his great <hi>Armies</hi> and <hi>Fleet,</hi> and put us to vaſt Expences to meet him, and in the mean time to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect our <hi>Merchandize,</hi> and ſtarve our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories abroad; and ſtifle up, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy with Fatigue and Sickneſs more Men than any Enemy's Engaging would do us; which is no ſmall diſpiriting of Men, who meet no chearful Rencounters, either of Prizes, Refreſhments of <hi>Foreign Countrys,</hi> and Viciſſitudes of Affairs; but only ſharp Commands, Wants, and Fatigues, Sickneſs, if not Death, and the painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of Deaths, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſee the Picture of Death ſo long before his Face, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Meſsmates</hi> and <hi>Comfratres</hi> going day by day before him, cauſed only by Want, and Fatigue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And when the <hi>French</hi>
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:47039:159"/>hath done his great Expedition, ſome ſuch thing as I ſaid before, and been a few Leagues at Sea; nay, perhaps, made the <hi>Lizard,</hi> or come up the <hi>Chanel,</hi> if the Wind be ſo that he may be ſure we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find him; but e're we come where he was, he is gone into Port; and then the <hi>Couriers</hi> flies with the News, That he hath been out, but could not find the <hi>Engliſh</hi> nor <hi>Dutch</hi> to fight; ſo they are come in only to refreſh their Men, and to take freſh Water, and was reſolved within Fourteen Days to ſeek for them, and if poſſible, to find them; which Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night being paſt, and a Month after that (perhaps) we may hear, That the Men he had collected from all the <hi>Sea-ports</hi> of the Nation, are a Month before that time returned cunningly, and no noiſe made; every one to his Station of preparing for a Voyage in a <hi>Privateer,</hi> and ready to put to Sea; and in the mean time the <hi>Seamen</hi> which the <hi>French
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:47039:160"/>King</hi> keeps in conſtant Pay, have by <hi>Michaelmas</hi> laid up his Ships ſafely, and put up the Stores ſafe, not knowing when he ſhall have any more, and clean up a few <hi>Fourth Rates</hi> and <hi>Frigats</hi> to cruiſe about in the Winter, and his Bulk of Men who are all diſperſed Home, perhaps have not coſt him above Four Pounds a Man; and now even before our <hi>Grand Fleet</hi> is returned Home, and eſpecially after the Seas ſwarm with <hi>Privateers</hi> and ſmall <hi>Frigats,</hi> and to be ſure all head <hi>Lands</hi> and <hi>Latitudes,</hi> where Ships uſually fall in with, are well plyed by them; ſo our <hi>Merchant-Men</hi> fall into their Mouths inevitably, and thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich them for all the Winter; and about <hi>April</hi> he ſends to all the <hi>Ports,</hi> that a Ship ſtirs not out of <hi>Port</hi> but is Muſtered by the <hi>King's Officer,</hi> where every Man's Name and Abode is put down, the which Regiſtry they alſo have in every <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,</hi> kept by their <hi>Intendant</hi> or <hi>Provoſt:</hi>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:47039:160"/>But now Security muſt be given to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn by ſuch a Day from Sea, to that or ſome other <hi>Port,</hi> by the <hi>Captain</hi> and <hi>Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi> ſo that by the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> a Summons may come to have them lay up their <hi>Privateers,</hi> and repair to ſuch Places for their Tranſport to <hi>Breſt,</hi> and receives every one a Crown Conduct Money, and ſo to act over the laſt Year again; yet to make the Sham hold good for another Year, they ſhall advance up the Chanel, that they might be ſeen and known to be there, they make Depredations on the Coaſt on Shoar, but be ſure not to meet a Body of our <hi>Fleet,</hi> that may or dares Fight them in ſet Battel, for there is Room enough in the Sea for ſuch Shams. And now I will leave the <hi>French Coaſts,</hi> and return to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> where, if we thus Dance after this Enemy, before or about <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> we believe it is too late for him to come forth, and we or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Ships Home, and the bigger we
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:47039:161"/>lay up, and leave a Squadron of the leſſer to cruiſe; but they Fowl and Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the reſt are gone to clean for a Relief to the others, which about the latter end of <hi>December</hi> are Releived; ſo the reſt are cleaned, and the Great Ships alſo; the Sick are put on Shoar and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed, and others goe home to ſee their Families, and the Ships are all Cleaned in the Winter in their Turns; and about <hi>February</hi> we begin to ſtir, and in <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April</hi> we ſcour the Land for Men; and of the ſame Men that went out the laſt Years Expedition, many are dead, nay more than by Fighting two General Battels in a Summer would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed; ſo by the middle of <hi>May,</hi> we may have Manned our <hi>Grand Fleet,</hi> and be ready to ſail ſoon after to the <hi>Weſtward;</hi> and if we pleaſe may act over ſome things, varying, but a like in the Main, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>French Ships</hi> be not hurt, but ſafely laid up with the Stores again, and
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:47039:161"/>that we have no <hi>Merchandize</hi> gone out, nor home, and many Seamen captived thereby; nay are brought to fight againſt us by Stratagem, and have loſt a great many Lives, and ſpent much Treaſure, and diſheartned our Men becauſe the edge of our Sword cuts not in Battel: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would that this dodging Enemy might be dealt with ſo, that he may not by his Craft keep a Fleet, and preſerve it only to keep us at a vaſt Fxpence of Lives and Treaſure, and diſhearten our Men for want of Action, and viciſſitudes of Fortune, as I ſaid before; and in the mean time Starve our Factories for want of Trade, ſo that we thrive not in Trade abroad nor at home, while we are at Wars with the Winds and Seas: I ſay, let us and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Joyn, and keep on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two good Fleets of <hi>Thirds, Fourths</hi> and <hi>Fifth Rates,</hi> and in the Summer time, ſome <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Second Rates</hi> for <hi>Flags, &amp;c.</hi> for it were well if no more
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:47039:162"/>than three <hi>Firſt,</hi> and three <hi>Second Rates</hi> were in <hi>England,</hi> and all the reſt <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Seconds</hi> could be wiſhed into <hi>Thirds, Fourths</hi> and <hi>Fifths,</hi> according to their Coſts, of which I will ſay more hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But, as I ſay, theſe two Grand Fleets conſiſting, <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> or Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Sail of Good Men of War, with as many Merchant-Men as could be Manned, to carry out and home our Merchantdize, and ſo to take their turns, that when one Fleet comes into the <hi>Downs</hi> with a <hi>Weſterly Wind,</hi> the other ſhould be ready to Sail outwards: I ſay, Seventy Sail of good Stout Men of War, each with a convenient number of Fire-Ships: Thus, there ſhould be built Thirty Sail of new light <hi>Frigats</hi> for Sailing and Rowing, with about Twenty Guns each, which ſhould ſerve for Scouts to the <hi>Grand Convoys,</hi> for Intelligence for ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off head Lands, and certain Latitudes, to give advice to Merchant-Men, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:47039:162"/>them from <hi>Capers;</hi> which by their Sailing and Rowing, being always kept clean for that purpoſe, that no Ship ſhould be able to Wrong them in the Seas; alſo with the ſaid <hi>Grand Convoys,</hi> ſhould go ſome Ships Loaden with Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials for Fire Ships, that upon any Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, that an Enemy is prepared to At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque the <hi>Grand Convoy,</hi> then they ſhould out of the ſaid Store Ships, fit their Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats into Fire-Ships, which would by their nimbleneſs do ſingular Service, and at their approach leave no more Men on Board than ſerves for a Fire-Ship to do ſervice with; this Fitting, I ſay, may be done at Sea, and upon a very ſmall warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or at the laſt Port they part with, to enter the Chanel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or where they may expect the grand Convoy to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacqued; which place and doubt being paſt, they may reduce them into ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Men of War, for the Uſes before: They being thus appointed, would be of
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:47039:163"/>extraordinary uſe to the Nation: It's pity there were not Forty Sail of them, ſome of Thirty Guns, but no bigger, they would be of mighty uſe to Ply off head Lands in the <hi>Chanel,</hi> be Scouts on the <hi>Enemies Coaſts,</hi> and approach great <hi>Fleets; Privateers</hi> would not care to meddle with them, by whom they ſhould get nought but Blows, and Hazards of the Fortunes of War: Theſe, I ſay, would ſerve for Convoys, for <hi>Colliers, Coaſters, New-found-land-men,</hi> and Ply the <hi>Capes,</hi> and head <hi>Lands</hi> of the Trading Places of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> that they be not ſo infeſted with Pirates; ſerve to attend our <hi>Collonies,</hi> carry Intelligence any whither; they would be of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful uſe: The neglect, and want of them, is ſufficiently experienc'd of late. And on the other ſide, providing of Great and Immenſe Caſtles of Ships, vaſt expence of Treaſure, conſtant, and growing Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, with little uſe to the Nation; of
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:47039:163"/>which I ſhall ſpeak more in the enſuing Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>I now return to the <hi>Grand Convoy,</hi> of which Frigats, they ſhould be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with Fifteen Sail each; the ſaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy to conſiſt of, I ſay, Seventy Sail of Ships, few leſs than Sixty Guns, and not above two of Eighty; but moſt of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty Guns, which will do great Service in General Fights, and dare lie by the ſide of any Ship, and be able to keep the Sea the Winter alſo; for the fitting out of great Ships, and laying them up again in four Months, is a vaſt Expence, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to Men; only ſerves to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Itch of Grandeur in ſome Men, and does little more than what a Ship of Seventy Guns will do, who ſtays out two or three Years on a Stretch; then the Men would have a Summ to receive, and neither they, nor the Service be unhinged ſo often. Now no Ship ſhould ſtir with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Lands-end,</hi> except for <hi>Ireland,</hi>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:47039:164"/>without the ſaid Convoy, nor to carry leſs than Thirty Guns, and Sixty Men; if any be found otherwiſe, they ſhould be ſeiſed by our <hi>Men of War,</hi> or <hi>Governors,</hi> and cauſed to pay a certain Fine to the King, ordered by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> or <hi>Council;</hi> and that this <hi>Grand Convoy</hi> do call at certain Seaſons, at leaſt twice, if not thrice in the Year, at one of the <hi>Weſtern Iſlands;</hi> but upon Recollection, there being no Harbours, or Road for ſo great a Fleet, wherefore <hi>Lisbon, Cadiz,</hi> or <hi>Gibraltar</hi> is better; but <hi>Cadiz</hi> is the moſt convenient and ſafe Road, where all our <hi>Merchant Ships</hi> ſhould have advice to come to from all parts of the World, who muſt come through the <hi>Chanel,</hi> out, or home; which <hi>Grand Convoy,</hi> at their coming there, and whiles they ſtay there, ſhould ſend out certain Frigats, and other Ships to Cruife at certain <hi>Latitudes,</hi> and <hi>head Lands,</hi> where Ships uſe to fall with, and ſecure them to the <hi>Grand Convoy,</hi>
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:47039:164"/>and if the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> at thoſe Iſlands ſhould harbour any <hi>French,</hi> or on their Coaſts to <hi>Privateer</hi> on us, they ſhould be Warred upon by us both, and treated as open Enemies; the which would pleaſe the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and cauſe them gladly to Entertain us: Then ſhall we not fatigue, and deſtroy our Men by ſo unhealthy ſtifling up, they being refreſhed in <hi>Foreign Ports,</hi> and getting ſomething, if not yet of experience of <hi>Countrys,</hi> and be made compleat <hi>Mariners,</hi> converſing through the World: Then alſo would we have ſome Trade go on, without ſo great Loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and he that is ſtrongeſt, to maintain their Trade through the Seas undiſturb'd, would have the beſt ſhare, and, in time, have the Dominion of the Seas; we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo lately let ſlip the Opportunity of a Receptacle for our <hi>Merchandize,</hi> as a Curb to all Trading through the <hi>Streights-Mouth,</hi> by the Demoliſhing of <hi>Tangier:</hi> The Convenience, and Importance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:47039:165"/>to <hi>England,</hi> ſhall I never forget, nor eaſily forgive the Loſs thereof; the Road and Mould had gotten a great many bad Qualities, when the deſign grew ripe for its Demoliſhing, which before had as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good, and was a means for their get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of <hi>Eſtates,</hi> who were inſtrumental in the Demoliſhing it, after vaſt Expences. Mighty pretty! But, I ſay, having loſt it ſo, we ought to ſecure ſome place of Certainty to us, about the <hi>Streights-mouth,</hi> as ſoon as we can find a fit opportunity, either by Marriage, or Wars; I wiſh we had the like of <hi>Tangier</hi> at this time, as it was at Demoliſhing, in lieu of a fourth of a Million of Money, it would not be too dear bought.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Corſairs</hi> of <hi>Algiers,</hi> &amp;c. in whoſe Wars (if I do not miſtake) the <hi>Dutch</hi> dealt more thriftily than us; for they always ſent their <hi>Merchandize</hi> in <hi>Fleets,</hi> with ſufficient <hi>Convoys,</hi> according to the ſtrength of thoſe <hi>Pirats;</hi> that if
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:47039:165"/>they would at any time bid up for them, they muſt lay a good Stake for the Betts; and if they ever won them, they would be dear <hi>Prizes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So I ſay, If ever the <hi>French</hi> would dare to attack theſe <hi>Grand Convoys,</hi> they ſhould buy them ſo dear, that they ſhould be no Gainers, and loſe ſoon the Capacity of diſturbing our Trade; for this way would force them to win what they get, by repelling Strength with Strength; the which being thus put into the Balances of War, they muſt needs prove too light for us both, if I am not mightily out in my Computation.</p>
               <p>Moreover, if they ſhould bid up for a Surprize, there is large room in the Seas, and variableneſs of <hi>Winds</hi> for to prove the Surpriſers ſurpriſed, and they be at equal Charges. I ſay, I do rather commend the former Proceedings of the <hi>Dutch</hi> in their Wars with the <hi>Algerines,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Corſairs</hi> of the <hi>Mediterrancan,</hi> by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:47039:166"/>than ours by keeping a Fleet to wait their Motions; if their Charges and ours were computed therein, I doubt, we ſhould be found much to exceed them: Indeed we may have done them more Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, but have received far greater Loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in our <hi>Merchandiſes:</hi> So that I muſt needs ſay, That the moſt Frugal way of Wars, and the moſt certain to avoid the Policies and Stratagems of our Enemies, that they do not put upon us; and where feweſt Accidents do attend our Loſſes, muſt needs be the beſt proceeding with any Enemy in Point of Management of War.</p>
               <p>But this general way of Management, may admit of particular Exceptions, if they alter their <hi>Meaſures,</hi> or <hi>Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> which part of Frugality leads me to ſay more thereto, than what I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſaid; which is, That we have laid out too much Treaſure in building too many
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:47039:166"/>great Ships of the the Firſt and Second Rates, with large Expences of adorning, by <hi>Carving, Gilding,</hi> and <hi>Painting,</hi> as I have before hinted; which great Ships lie by, and are maintained at vaſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, and ſerve but very ſeldom, or rarely for the Defence of the <hi>Nation,</hi> and Preſervation of our <hi>Merchandize</hi> in Foreign Parts, they being not fit for all <hi>Voyages,</hi> nor all <hi>Seas;</hi> and whenſoever they are uſed, they are attended with double and treble accidents of War for loſs, and not to equal advantages to the ſtrength of the <hi>Navy,</hi> proportionable to the coſts, and of Men required; as for example:</p>
               <p>A Ship of One Hundred Guns, ſhall carry near One Thouſand Men, and Two Ships of Seventy Guns each, or Four of Forty Six Guns, or Seven of Thirty Two Guns each, and are not full the Charges of one of thoſe great Ships, and they are
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:47039:167"/>not liable to the Hazard and Caſualties of <hi>War</hi> or <hi>Seas,</hi> as they are: I might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the Accident to be Ten time leſs of the Smaller, and Ten times more of Uſe. I would fain know of any one, whether one of Seventy, one of Forty Six, and two of Thirty Two Guns, were not Ten times oftner in Service to the Nation, and Ten times leſs Accidents attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them at Sea, and yet of leſs Coſt to the Nation: Then may I conclude there is now near Sixteen Sail of great Ships which are under the ſaid Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances to the Nation, and are for maintainance conſtantly every Year, at near Forty Thouſand Pounds coſt lying ſtill; wherefore I cannot commend the building and repairing of ſome of them fallen into decay; but to let the application be to the multyplying of Ships of the leſſer Ranks; the which expences will be of Ten times the ſervice to the Nation, as before proved, and not to forget to ſave
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:47039:167"/>one <hi>Fifth Rate,</hi> out of a <hi>Firſt Rates Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, Gilding</hi> and <hi>Painting;</hi> for the Ships need no more adorning, than what is of uſe for Fighting; only ſome Ships might be kept adorned and beautified for Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of <hi>Princes</hi> or <hi>Ambaſſadors,</hi> &amp;c. as Ships for <hi>State;</hi> ſo was it heretofore, but of late Years we have run to a ſtrange profuſeneſs: For great <hi>Shipwrights</hi> have created us great Ships, or rather great Ships created <hi>Shipwrights;</hi> it being a time now to turn Frugal the right way, for lately the pretence for Frugality was lent to the retrenching of the Poor, needy, ſtanding Officers in their Pay, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting of unreaſonable and unknown duty from them, void of ſerviceableneſs to the <hi>King,</hi> and run the Treaſure away by great Contracts ſecretly and cuningly carried, and the main point of keeping the <hi>Navy</hi> ready and well prepared with able and well appointed Officers, for the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:47039:168"/>defence and ſafety of the Honour and Wealth of the Nation, and at the moſt Frugal rates for the eaſe of the King and People, was made even as a ſcrew that is made for to turn the wrong way, and ſcrew againſt the Sun, and in the Interim, our <hi>Builders, Contrivers,</hi> and <hi>Ship-Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectures</hi> goe over into <hi>France,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive or build them Ships of War, or what elſe.</p>
               <p>So hoping I have ſaid enough, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite us to look a little to the Frugal part of the Management of the <hi>Navy,</hi> and rightly to apply the Treaſure, and alſo to inſpect what ſort of Officers have been crammed into the <hi>Navy,</hi> and whether private Intereſt, Trick, and Deſign, have not been buſie and prevalent through the whole Series thereof; and if it be found Sick and Diſtempered, perhaps ſome ſeaſonable Pills of <hi>Extractum Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lulae Abdicationis</hi> would do much hood,

            <head>A Ballance of Trade, between FRANCE and US, in Times of Peace.</head>
            <p>TRADE between Nation and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is of that Weight and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, to the Welfare, Safety, and Peace thereof, that very often bloody Wars are made, and proſecuted fiercely for the procuring and maintaining there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; for by it Kingdoms and States be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Opulent, and Populous, which is the ſtrength thereof; and therefore, for the Preſervation thereof, and that the neighbouring Nations do not either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine us, in our <hi>Foreign Trade</hi> with
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:47039:169"/>others, or over-balance us in the Trade between us and them, 'tis neceſſary I ſay ſomewhat.</p>
            <p>To theſe two Points I will ſpeak here of <hi>France</hi> only, and by them to grow Rich, Populous, and Strong; and we, in the Interim, either ſtand ſtill, or decline to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Weakneſs, and Poverty; or yet, if we do neither, but increaſe our Wealth from our Trade with others, which proves gainful to us; and we are bereft of that Wealth by a Series of Commerce with a Potent, and neighbouring People, who bend themſelves, by more than ordinary means, (I might ſay, Unrighteous, and Inhumane Pollicies, to enlarge their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,) even like thoſe Governments I have elſewhere ſpoken of: Then every degree or ſtep we permit them to take towards it, will prove to us, like the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out of one Scale, and putting it into the other, at the wrong end of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, and ſo will it become a double
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:47039:170"/>Weight, in point of balancing Riches, and Strength. I need not Inculcate far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the uſual means by which Nations do become Rich, and Strong; and thereby do ſpread their Plumes, or Tallons, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther over their neighbouring Nations; and, in fine, ſubject them to their Laws, and Injunctions; which Hiſtory doth plentifully afford, whither I refer you: But I will only give you one Maxim, or Inſtance, of Accumulating Riches, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Foundation of Strength; which Inſtance ſhall be in the more private Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of Men, <hi>viz.</hi> Thus:</p>
            <p>If a <hi>Nobleman, Gentleman, Merchant,</hi> or <hi>Tradeſman,</hi> &amp;c. does in his Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Expences of his Family, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume or expend more than his either Eſtate or Profits clearly brings in; or that he does not make a due Calculation thereof, and give a full allowance for his Loſſes of Rent, or Moneys, by bad Debts, Repairs of Lands, Houſes, or
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:47039:170"/>Damages of Goods: I ſay, if he does not give a full allowance, on his Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation thereof, but continues his Port and Expences to the heigth, he muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, at the approach of thoſe Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, be diſappointed; and muſt inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly fall into decay of his Wealth, and, in time, come into Poverty; which might be applyed to the Politick Bodies of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, or Nations: For if a Kingdom, or Common-wealth, do by their Trade import more Goods into it, the which is therein conſumed and expended in their Adornings and Luxury, than they do Export of their <hi>Product,</hi> or <hi>Manufact:</hi> I ſay, with whatſoever Nation they do thus Trade, they are <hi>Looſers</hi> by them; and the Overplus, or Balance of that <hi>Trade,</hi> muſt be made good with <hi>Bulloin</hi> in <hi>Specie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, If any <hi>Nation</hi> Trading to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with <hi>Product,</hi> or <hi>Manufact;</hi> and that <hi>Nation</hi> do by their Laws, lay a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:47039:171"/>Tax, or Impoſt upon their <hi>Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi> ſo then the <hi>Prince,</hi> and <hi>Publick Treaſury</hi> of that <hi>Nation,</hi> receives the greateſt Gains by that Product, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufact, and has the Labours and Product of the other <hi>Nation,</hi> to turn to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching: Eſpecially if again in lieu of the former Product and Manufact, they do Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Product and Manufact from the ſaid <hi>Kingdom,</hi> or <hi>Nation,</hi> and do not lay a like <hi>Impoſition,</hi> that their Publick Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure may alſo receive a like Profit from the <hi>Commodities</hi> from them ſo Imported, here is an uneven Balance of Trade: And yet more unevenneſs in Trade, is, when the <hi>Commodities</hi> of the one <hi>Nation</hi> Exported, is only for the ſuſtaining of Life, or Proviſions for <hi>Military Strength;</hi> and what the other Exports is ſpent alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in <hi>Adornings, Pleaſures, Luxury,</hi> and <hi>Debauchery:</hi> This again makes an uneven Balance in Trade, and tends to the weakening and impoveriſhing of that
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:47039:171"/>
               <hi>Nation,</hi> that Trades for the Importation of <hi>Vanities,</hi> and <hi>Pleaſures,</hi> and to the enriching and ſtrengthening of thoſe who Trade for the <hi>Importation of Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> which ſerves the Neceſſity of <hi>Life,</hi> or <hi>Proviſions of War:</hi> In which there is a real, intrinſick value inherent, and a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity thereof: Whereas the <hi>Pleaſures, Vanities,</hi> and <hi>Luxuries,</hi> might better be ſpared; it tending to nothing, but the Softening, Effeminating, and Debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the People; deſtroying their Proweſs, and at the end will make them both <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmartial,</hi> and in time expoſe them to the <hi>Inſult</hi> and <hi>Conqueſt</hi> of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>I remember, I have read in the Hiſtory of <hi>Anthony Duverdier</hi> his Obſervation of the Antient and Modern Times; that whenſoever a <hi>Nation</hi> hath been known to Imitate and Adore another <hi>Nation</hi> in their <hi>Manners, Faſhions, Diets, Sports,</hi> &amp;c. they have proved to be the <hi>Inſult</hi> and
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:47039:172"/>
               <hi>Conqueſt</hi> of that <hi>Nation: God</hi> avert his <hi>Judgments</hi> from <hi>England,</hi> and give us a timely ſight; for whenever we loſe the <hi>Dominion of the Seas,</hi> we lie the openeſt for <hi>Invaſion</hi> of any in the <hi>World;</hi> our Shipping being inſtead of <hi>ſtrong Garriſons</hi> in every <hi>Province,</hi> to prevent the ſudden over-running our <hi>Country,</hi> which <hi>Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> others have, and we not.</p>
            <p>Again, If two <hi>Nations,</hi> as aforeſaid, Trading, and the one Imports from the other of its <hi>Products</hi> and <hi>Manufacts,</hi> in ſuch Sorts, and Species, of the which they might ſupply themſelves tollerably well at home; but they neglect it, and ſend their Silver for the others; which is again uneven Balancing, and bad <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if I miſtake not, our <hi>Trade</hi> with <hi>France,</hi> for near Thirty Years paſt, hath run with a very uneven Balance, <hi>viz.</hi> The Importation of their <hi>Commodities,</hi> hath far exceeded our Exportations to
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:47039:172"/>them; and the <hi>Commodities</hi> we receive from them, as <hi>Wines, Wrought-Silk, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and abundance of <hi>Novels,</hi> for <hi>Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> all which are paid for, by either <hi>Bulloin</hi> tranſported, or elſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by Bills of <hi>Exchange</hi> out of <hi>Spain</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> for <hi>Commodities</hi> vended into <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Product, or Effects, by <hi>Money, viz.</hi> the Surpluſage of that <hi>Trade</hi> is effected into <hi>France,</hi> and hath been no ſmall occaſion of the Growth of the Wealth and Strength thereof, within the ſaid Years: Had not this <hi>Nation</hi> had a vaſt <hi>Trade</hi> with its <hi>Woollen Manufacts</hi> elſewhere, it muſt needs have had a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable apprehenſion thereof long ſince; which <hi>Trade of Vanities,</hi> if they had been Limited, Prohibited, or a great Impoſt laid thereon, what Wealth of <hi>Bulloin</hi> would it have cauſed to have remained in <hi>England;</hi> nay, a <hi>prodigious</hi> quantity; whoſe Expences have been wholly <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſely vain,</hi> and <hi>debauchedly hurtful,</hi> to the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:47039:173"/>
               <hi>People</hi> of this <hi>Nation</hi> in general, effemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and corrupting them in both <hi>Military</hi> and <hi>Civil Affairs;</hi> and enriching and ſtrengthening the <hi>French</hi> by this uneven Balance; the Superfluities of our other <hi>Trades</hi> being turned to their <hi>Profit;</hi> that although we had a great <hi>Trade</hi> abroad, yet it has had a profuſe Currant thereof into <hi>France,</hi> like unto the <hi>Story</hi> I have read of two <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who went to the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> together, to adventure for Silver, intending to live there ſome Years, and return into <hi>Spain</hi> with their Wealth: The one when arrived, applyed himſelf to the <hi>Mines,</hi> to adventure there for <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver;</hi> the other he addicted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to <hi>Farming</hi> and <hi>Husbandry,</hi> in <hi>Feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Cattle,</hi> and <hi>Tilling of Land for Corn:</hi> So the <hi>Miner,</hi> as he got Money, came and bought <hi>Proviſions</hi> with it of the <hi>Husband-man;</hi> and when the term expired, the <hi>Miner</hi> came home little the richer; but the <hi>Husband-man</hi> very rich.
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:47039:173"/>So I ſay, That although we have had a vaſt <hi>Trade</hi> for near Thirty Years paſt, yet we have ſpent a <hi>prodigious</hi> quantity thereof with the <hi>French</hi> for <hi>Commodities,</hi> which we might better have been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, they ſerving only for <hi>Debauchery</hi> and <hi>Luxury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Salt we had from them, which ſeems to be of neceſſity; It might have been as well ſupplyed us by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Portugueze Territories,</hi> with what our own Nation could not have done: Yet great Improvement might have been made therein, if large Impoſt had heen laid on the <hi>French,</hi> but the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> Commodities are all Purchaſed with our Manufact, and at good Price, beſides a ſurpluſage of Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loin coming therefrom, and maintains a greater <hi>Navigation,</hi> which does all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to our <hi>Wealth</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> and tends not to the inriching of our Potent and Malevolent Neighbour; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:47039:174"/>is a thing of a double Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to us, even like a pleaſant Plant bearing two ſorts of Fruit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to be digged about, and dunged.</p>
            <p>Now as to the <hi>Linen</hi> Trade with <hi>France,</hi> it might have ſtood well enough with us, if it had been evenly carried between us, as it had been heretofore, that our <hi>Woolen</hi> Manufacts did purchaſe them, and all other of our Trade with <hi>France;</hi> for very little <hi>French Wines</hi> were Imported then; but afterwards our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of them grew to a prodigious quantity, and the Prices of them ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanced, that we ſet his Subjects to Work on a vaſt Improvement of <hi>Vineyards,</hi> and greatly to his Inriching; and he at the ſame time ſetting to Work, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging of his Subjects to the Improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Woollen Manufact,</hi> and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo great an impoſition upon our <hi>Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Exported;</hi> Nay, they have vended
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:47039:174"/>no ſmall quantities of <hi>Woollen Manufact</hi> to us.</p>
            <p>So, I ſay, as to our Trade with <hi>France,</hi> the large Importations from thence, and the neglecting and debaſing the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Trade, have been a proceeding not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be ranked amongſt the Politicks, and therefore fit to fall under conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for Redreſs; and finding our <hi>Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Manufact</hi> is done for Purchaſe of <hi>Linen</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and that both <hi>France, Holland, Flanders</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> having advanced far into the ſaid <hi>Wollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facts,</hi> and muſt needs leſſen our cheif de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance thereon: It would be very Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and Politick in us, to ſet heartily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Linen Manufact;</hi> I mean, that ſort wherewith we uſed to be ſupplyed from <hi>France,</hi> viz. <hi>Dowleſs, Lockrams,</hi> and all ſorts of <hi>Canvaſſes:</hi> The <hi>Manufact</hi> of <hi>Paper,</hi> we having made a fair progreſs therein already, and the advance of the <hi>Linen Trade,</hi> will alſo advance the <hi>Paper;</hi>
               <pb n="312" facs="tcp:47039:175"/>for it is not Fifty Years paſt, ſince <hi>France</hi> began it's gteat Improvement of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Trade:</hi> Now as to the <hi>Linen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fact,</hi> I argue thus: Our People, and chiefly the Women kind, by the Increaſe of them, and Decreaſe of our <hi>Wollen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacts,</hi> occaſioned by the advance of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries, made there into, will not have Imployment, to become ſo profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the State, as they might; for a great part of the <hi>Linen Manufact</hi> is done by Women and Children: Now our Lands are ſufficiently apt to produce the plentiful growth of <hi>Flax,</hi> ſo would a great part thereof be Imployed thereto; that Land that is moſt proper, <hi>viz. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-Land</hi> for the growth of <hi>Flax;</hi> and as otherwiſe, by our Experience and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement we ſhall find out, and being Imployed thereto, which is now either Imployed to Paſture for <hi>Fleſh,</hi> or to Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage for <hi>Corn;</hi> we ſhould not abound in Proviſions, as before I have Intimated, in
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:47039:175"/>the caſe of <hi>Fiſhery,</hi> or keeping of <hi>Lent;</hi> and ſhould maintain abundance of our People therein, and preſerve the Money in our Nation, that hath formerly been ſent into <hi>France</hi> to buy it.</p>
            <p>Some will ſay, That we can have it out of <hi>France</hi> Cheaper.</p>
            <p>But I anſwer: It is now come to that paſs, that we can make it near as cheap our ſelves, as they ſell it us, for which we ſend ready Money; and if we do at any time ſend away <hi>Woollen Manufact</hi> for it, that by their <hi>Impoſt</hi> laid on it, we muſt make it here at ſo low a price, that our <hi>People</hi> muſt live at an exceeding low Rate; as alſo, the <hi>Wools</hi> muſt be at a low price, or elſe we cannot ſell them any: Wherefore it behoveth us to lay a large <hi>Impoſt</hi> on theirs, whenſoever it ſhall be permitted to be <hi>Imported;</hi> that our <hi>People</hi> might be incouraged to make it.</p>
            <pb n="314" facs="tcp:47039:176"/>
            <p>And to <hi>promote</hi> and <hi>encourage</hi> the ſaid <hi>Manufact,</hi> here ſhould be a kind of a willing Conſtraint on our ſelves, thus:</p>
            <p>Let there be a certain Sum of Money, raiſed over the <hi>Nation,</hi> by an Act, in the nature of a <hi>Royal Aid;</hi> which being col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, let it be paid into the <hi>High Sheriff</hi> of the <hi>County,</hi> as a <hi>Treaſurer;</hi> and at the General <hi>Quarter-Seſſions,</hi> held for the ſaid <hi>County,</hi> let every <hi>Hundred,</hi> or <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> produce one ſufficient Perſon, who ſhall give Security for the ſaid <hi>Money,</hi> and take it for Seven Years, Intereſt free, upon Condition, That he will imploy the ſaid Money, in making of <hi>Lockram, Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> or <hi>Convas</hi> out of <hi>Flax,</hi> of the growth of <hi>England;</hi> and after the ſaid Seven Years, let the Money be paid into the ſaid <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> and he pay it back to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Perſon</hi> from whom it was collected, or to the Heirs, or Aſſignes of ſuch Parties: Or elſe by another Act, continued for ſome Years longer, or laid out upon ſome

            </p>
            <p>And, whereas I have, in this foregoing <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> for the increaſe of <hi>Maritime People,</hi> which, by a ſort of willing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, are addicted to <hi>Maritime Lives,</hi> by taking all the <hi>Male Children,</hi> of <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Indigent Parents,</hi> and Binding them to the <hi>Sea,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>I do not herein endeavour to Dictate, or Methodize the way in particular, for the <hi>Act of Parliament;</hi> but I do only hint it, <hi>Rough-hue</hi> it out, to be <hi>Regulated</hi> and <hi>Poliſhed</hi> by the Skilful.</p>

            <head>A brief Summary of the whole VVork.</head>
            <p>AS <hi>God Almighty</hi> hath made <hi>Fire, Air, Earth,</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> the wonderful Works of his own Hands, in the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the World; and therein hath put Man, and given him a Dominion over all the Creatures he hath been pleaſed to furniſh his Immenſe Globe with, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them all living Breath in Common; yet unto Mankind hath he given a more particular and ineſtimable Gift, <hi>viz.</hi> a Portion of his Holy and Divine Spirit, that by Wiſdom and Juſtice, he might Rule and Govern the ſame: To which he has added (by the Writing of his own Finger) Laws of his Almighty's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:47039:179"/>to be a Guide and Pattern for him: And alſo more particularly Inſpired <hi>Princes, Prophets, Priests, Evangeliſts, Apoſtles,</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> to promulgate his Will; and yet more, that there might nothing be lacking to compleat Man's happineſs in this World, and in the World to come, <hi>viz.</hi> to all Eternity, and be left without all manner of excuſe; he hath ſent from his own Boſome, his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Son; the Heir apparent and Lord of the everlaſting Inheritance, and given him to be a Sacrifice, to ſatisfie his Juſtice, to wipe out all the Stores of the Sins of all Mankind; and not only ſo, but to amplifie and confirm the Doctrines of thoſe holy Men, hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed he will continue his Holy Ghoſt to guide Man to the World's End; and preſerve him from the implacable hatred, the Devil hath unto him: Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, all theſe helps Mankind, by the inſtigation of the Evil one, together
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:47039:179"/>with his own evil will and affections, falls into the abominable Sin of Pride, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſin that moved God to Disband and Expel out of his Heavenly Manſion, ſome of his <hi>Glorious Hoaſt.</hi> I ſay, it is this ſin of Pride, by ſeeking for <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> over others, is the cauſe of thoſe great <hi>Devastations</hi> of <hi>Countries,</hi> of <hi>Blood ſhed</hi> of Men, the one endeavouring by <hi>Policy</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> to gain the other's <hi>Right;</hi> not caring for God's <hi>Laws, promulgated</hi> by thoſe holy orders of Men aforeſaid, or by God <hi>Incarnate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore it is of abſolute neceſſity for all good Men, by Chriſtian Policy, and united Strength, to reſiſt the Proud; for God giveth Grace to the humble, to be content with their own, and to defend it; yet whenſoever right is put into the Balance of War, God giveth it an Iſſue according to his Divine purpoſe; by which Iſſue he transfers Rights from the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:47039:180"/>one to the other: Now there is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a right of <hi>Dominion</hi> belonging to Countries, by their Diviſions, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſions of Land, but alſo of the Seas; for every Country bordering upon the Ocean, hath a particular <hi>Dominion</hi> in the Seas, <hi>viz.</hi> to govern it, and to keep and preſerve it from <hi>Pirates</hi> and <hi>Robbers,</hi> that Men might paſs in ſafety, about their Lawful Occaſions; and alſo, to take the <hi>Product</hi> thereof, as Fiſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as God hath endued it with.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Dominion</hi> of the <hi>Narrow Seas,</hi> being from antient <hi>Hiſtory</hi> always allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and granted, upon all <hi>Treaties</hi> and <hi>Conditions</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> made between all the bordering Nations, to be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Right of the Imperial <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> God having placed it an Iſland, in the <hi>Deucalidan Ocean,</hi> which makes the <hi>Narrow Seas,</hi> and ſtored it with <hi>Ports</hi> and <hi>Rivers,</hi> convenient for the receiving
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:47039:180"/>of Ships, beyond any other Nation in <hi>Europe;</hi> and furniſhing it with <hi>Timber</hi> and <hi>Iron</hi> of their own <hi>Product,</hi> for the building of Ships; and alſo, a People ſufficiently apt for the ſame, as it were pointing unto us with his Almighty Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to Rule and Govern in it, which our former Princes have done without ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Blood or Treaſure to accompliſh it: But now the <hi>French</hi> King maketh very large Efforts, to the bereaving us of that Right, and Pirating, Roving, and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaging in it, he having been increaſed in <hi>Shipping, Navigation,</hi> and <hi>Wealth,</hi> by our late Impolitick Proceedings.</p>
            <p>Firſt, by permitting the uneven ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of Trade with us: And</p>
            <p>Secondly, By directing or ſuffering the changing the ancient and Expeditious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of the Diſcipline and Government of the <hi>Navy Royal;</hi> putting it into the hands of <hi>deſigning Projectors,</hi> to enrich
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:47039:181"/>themſelves, only confounding the Affair: exhauſting much Treaſure, to multiply great Ships of little uſe to our purpoſe; and neglecting of leſſer Ships, which we now want; diſcouraging, and diſanima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, <hi>Warranted,</hi> bnd <hi>Standing Officers, Mariners,</hi> and <hi>Seamen;</hi> by blind-folding Pretences of ſtrict obſervance of Duty, needleſs; and from preſerving the <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> from being rooked of his Pay, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving liberty to diſpoſe of it as he pleaſes; for which purpoſe, he hath not been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed an open Market for the ſame on Shoar, to bring it into Money into his Pocket; nor yet on Board allowed a Market, where more than one Seller for Cloathing, and other of their Wants; which Methods, I ſay, have greatly diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated all the <hi>Maritime People</hi> under a <hi>Commiſſion Officer:</hi> And, I fear, by the Novels introduced, have brought Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Confuſion on it, to the great
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:47039:181"/>impeding thereof: Wherefore it is high time, if it be not too late, to awaken out of this Lethargy, to recover our <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, Honour,</hi> and <hi>Proweſs,</hi> before it be paſt recovery, now in this inſtant War with <hi>France;</hi> to effect which, the <hi>Nation</hi> muſt not ſpare Blood nor Treaſure, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it prove a <hi>Work</hi> of time; and great <hi>Maritime Expences</hi> muſt be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued until it be gained; without which, no laſting Peace, or Happineſs can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected for us to enjoy; for the Sword be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn by ſo many hands, to carve themſelves a ſhare out of this ſaid <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time Dominion,</hi> we are not able to judge, how Sides may be taken; or with whom we may happen to deal with, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Seas may enjoy a ſetled Peace: Wherefore I emplore the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates</hi> in <hi>Parliament,</hi> to put the <hi>Navy</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a poſture of great and conſtant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, to diſpoyl this <hi>Common Enemy</hi> of

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:47039:183"/>from time to time, to Govern, Fight, and Manage the ſaid <hi>Navy;</hi> and to perform which, they Conſtitute <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> of the <hi>Navy,</hi> to negotiate under them, and by their Dictates and Approbation, to prepare and provide Ships, Men, Stores, and all Neceſſaries, Proviſions, Moneys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to Diſpoſe, Account, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame, as Deputies of the <hi>Lord High Admiral;</hi> having each his diſtinct Claſs, or Order, to act in; yet a certain number thereof confirms all Actions, <hi>viz.</hi> three of them, whereof one is needful to be the <hi>Comptroller,</hi> him unto whoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Office, the ſaid Matters do more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately relate, whoſe Clerks, in each Office, are under their reſpective Inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and Directions for Diſpatches, to keep them to their Duties; duly obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Errors, in Methods, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, in Diſpatches; yet not wholly confined to their reſpective Offices, but
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:47039:183"/>to mark all Errors in all others, nay, of all Degrees and Orders of the <hi>Navy,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Lord High Admiral;</hi> but if they are deſigned to live at eaſe, and let Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſlide, and do Juſtice as the unjuſt Judge did, becauſe he was wearied by the Complainant, that he could not reſt, and no otherwiſe: If he let Officers do their Diſpatches at their Leiſures, Secretaries, Clerks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do moſt of the buſineſs. I ſay, if their Actions are with too much Grandeur and Deliberation, and promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate their Pleaſures, at too great diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and through too many Doors: And if they move in the Affairs, as ſome Country Juſtices doe to do Juſtice to their Country; for at their procuring the Commiſſion, it was but to give them Authority to puniſh thoſe that offended themſelves, or Friends, in their Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Rights, or ſlighted their Grandeur; but to ſerve their Countrey, or take pains
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:47039:184"/>to diſtribute Juſtice to relieve the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and reſtore Men to loſt Rights; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Peace and Amity in Neighbourhoods, puniſh Malefactors and Offenders, and for doing this, and many more good Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, ſpends his Time and Moneys at <hi>Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes</hi> and <hi>Seſſions,</hi> he never intended any more than to live well himſelf, and let the World Sink or Swim: I ſay, if ſuch like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings be in the <hi>Navy,</hi> then I conclude it has gotten a filthy Diſeaſe, the <hi>Lethargy;</hi> and to a waken it out of its Drowſinefs, there ought to be ſome ſharp Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Wherefore I project, that there ſhould be another Officer created in the <hi>Navy, viz.</hi> a Superſeding Officer, ſuch as the <hi>French</hi> call an Intendant; but I affect not the <hi>French</hi> Name nor Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but the <hi>Latines</hi> or <hi>Romans,</hi> a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor; one that ſhould Cenſure all Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in the <hi>Navy,</hi> under the <hi>Lord High Admiral,</hi> and be <hi>Commiſſioned</hi> by him, to
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:47039:184"/>go and fit at all Boards, Inſpect all Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Books, and obſerve their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods and Practices in diſpatches; and cenſure dictate, direct, and correct the Errors, quicken the Diſpatches, hear all Grievances and Complaints, ſuſpend all Contumelious, Negligent, Diſhoneſt, Diſloyal, and offending Officers; refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the <hi>Admiralty</hi> for their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, whither he ſhould tranſmit their Faults, in a fair written Accuſation, taken before him, at the place by his Clerk, for that Purpoſe, where the Accuſers and Accuſed <hi>(Viva Voce)</hi> ſhould anſwer, and Oaths for Proof admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in Material cauſes; and ſhould viſit all the <hi>Ports, Yards, &amp;c.</hi> and go on board the Ships, Flags, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and enquire into all Miſdemeanors; and at his coming into any <hi>Yard</hi> or <hi>Ship,</hi> there ſhould be a Signal hung out, that all Men may know that the <hi>Cenſor</hi> is there; and that there is
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:47039:185"/>free liberty for any one to exhibit their Complaints, or Informations, which ſhould be received with all Clemency and Mildneſs imaginable, and written in a Book there, and tranſcribed fairly into a Ledger-Book, by a Clerk for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe kept in the <hi>Admiralty Office;</hi> called the <hi>Black Book</hi> for ſome, <hi>viz.</hi> Offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the <hi>White Book</hi> for the Meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; wherein the <hi>Admiralty</hi> may, upon all Occaſions, for laying aſide of any undeſerving Men; ſee their former Faults, and how many, and how often committed; and for Preferment their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, and how often, and how long waited for Preferment; here would be a Mirrour for the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> and a true Portraicture of all the Affairs ready at all times before them; and may not, nay, cannot be ſo eaſily miſguided in ſo great an Affair, if it be rightly managed, he ſhould be in conſtant motion, and ſoon
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:47039:185"/>be at the Ports, Ships, and Places where he is little expected: And again, at the <hi>Navy,</hi> and <hi>Admiralty Boards, Treaſury, Victualling-Office Board,</hi> at <hi>Pays,</hi> &amp;c. he ought to have a good Sallary, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Travelling, Charges to bear his Port above the Malice of evil Men, with which he will be ſufficiently embroiled, if he quits his Duty with Faithfulneſs and Courage; and therefore he ought to have great Countenance from, and free Acceſs and Communication with the <hi>Admiralty Board</hi> at all times; then would Deſigners, Trickers, Private-Intereſt-makers, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezlers, Private Contractors, evil Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Commanders, pull in their Heads, and not dare to commit ſuch Faults, knowing that the Pooreſt man may have his Cauſe eaſily ſcanned, and ſoon cenſured with equal Favour and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; and a Record thereof remain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its Deſerts, without travelling
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:47039:186"/>far to great Offices, and when come there, knows not what Door to knock at, nor whom to ask for; and with an Anſwer from the Door-keeper, That they are not to be ſpoke with yet; or not within; or that it is not the right Office, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects him to another; and there he finds the like Anſwer: And ſo he returns wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, his Money ſpent, and no whit the wiſer: And perhaps for this Endeavour, if it come to the Offenders Ear, he ſhall be totally cruſhed. I ſay, this Officer of <hi>Cenſor</hi> would be the very Vital Spirits running through every Member of this Politick Body of the <hi>Navy,</hi> and warm every part thereof with the ſweet Beams of his Juſtice, and cauſe Men to come chearfully into the Service, and endure the Fatigues, Labours, Wants, Wounds, and Diſorders incident to the Affair, with all imaginable Patience and Alacrity; for Juſtice would wait at their Doors: So
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:47039:186"/>that I ſay, This Office added to ſome of the Regulations herein ſuggeſted, <hi>viz.</hi> courtailing of intricate Methods, ſpuring and moderating of Clerks, expelling the Monopolizing of the Sailers Markets for Cloathing and Neceſſaries, and relief for their Families, by having a free and open Market to ſell their Tickets, or ingage their Pay; by taking off the Scandal and Abuſes of Religion in the Miniſterial Function; by having Moderate, Friendly Juſt, Sober Diſcreet, yet Abſolute, and every way good Commands carried; it would produce ſuch a Harmony in the Affair, that all good Officers would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce together; ſtrive to exceed each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the performance of Duty; and the Sailer would prefer the Service, before any Merchants Service.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For that he is defended from all ill Men, from any wrong that may be done to him.</p>
            <pb n="336" facs="tcp:47039:187"/>
            <p>Secondly, That there is room for him to exerciſe his Ingenuity, Labour, and Induſtry, in Art, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which there he has a fair proſpect of Preferment to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Wealth.</p>
            <p>And Laſtly, That he has a good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of allowance of wholſome Diet, and large Wages, well anſwered to him; and in his Sickneſs Proviſion for him; and for loſs of Limbs an Allowance, during Life; and in Caſes of Captivity, or Death in Battle, ſome Benevolence for his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: All which, I ſay, would animate and invite any Man that has any ſpark, or ſenſe of Grace, or Goodneſs, Prudence, or Honeſty, or grain of Genius; to croud and ſcrew himſelf into the Service, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in <hi>Merchants Imployments,</hi> he hath not a fourth part of the Chances for his good Fortunes, and ten times the Chances for his ill Fortunes.</p>
            <pb n="337" facs="tcp:47039:187"/>
            <p>And again, That he would by the Methods herein ſuggeſted, be without hopes of evading the Service, by ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or bribing of the <hi>Preſs-Maſters,</hi> his Name, Aboad, and Voyages, too well kept account of for his Eſcape. I ſay, theſe things ſo well Joynted, Ferneered, and Cemented together, would make a beautiful Body Politick, which would ſerve the true ends thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> preſerve and maintain the Honour, Glory, Peace, and Tranquillity of their Majeſties, and their Kingdoms; for without the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of which <hi>Navy,</hi> as I ſaid before, theſe Kingdoms can have no hopes of Safety, from being invaded by the Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful at Sea: Their <hi>Collonies</hi> all deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Trade with it, and being an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland, lie sopen to all Invaſions and Allarms of Enemies; being diveſted of Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Inlands, to ſtop the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Inundations of Foreigners: The
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:47039:188"/>Dangers whereof, I need not farther to Inculcate.</p>
            <p>And for the more caſe of the Nation, to bear theſe large Expences of <hi>Naval Forces,</hi> and the expoſing to loſs the Lives of ſo many of the Inhabitants thereof, I have projected, a Thrift in the building, and repairing of Ships, moſt uſeful for us, and by ſparing the profuſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal Expences therein; and a right ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the Treaſure, ſtopping growing Charges, by diſcharging Men by Tickets, if Money be not ready; the Money'd Men would buy them with little loſs, if they may receive it again with Credit; the Nation's Credit being paſt for it; and the Sailer be plentifully ſupply'd with Content: And for the ſupplying the loſs of <hi>Mariners,</hi> which muſt follow this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, I have projected a ſure, and never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>failing Seminary of <hi>Seamen,</hi> to proceed from the Male Children of Poor and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:47039:188"/>People, and by the incouragement of <hi>Fiſhery;</hi> and by putting into Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Ships ſome of the King's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, For our preſent War with <hi>France,</hi> I have hinted Meaſures, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we might maintain our Trade, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel their Power; I being then upon that Subject, when it was ſuppoſed, that the two Fleets were Ingaged; not knowing then, nor yet can find the Reaſons for their bold Attempt; having the greateſt Diſadvantages attending them, and we the greateſt Advantages attending us: That the Proceedings is a Myſtery, an Abyſs, and Occult matter to me; and therefore I will not farther wade therein: Yet I find no Reaſons to retract my then Sentiments in the General, which muſt admit of ſome particular Exceptions, as Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances do vary, as I there have ſaid.</p>
            <pb n="340" facs="tcp:47039:189"/>
            <p>And to preſerve our Wealth at home, I have projected a Balance of Trade with <hi>France,</hi> by a due Eſtimation of their Goods to be Imported to us, and equal Impoſts laid; and to encourage a <hi>Linen Manufact</hi> here, by the poor Females of the Nation, and to ſhun all Maintainance to Idle and Slothful Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>Now, I confeſs, I have let ſlip one main Matter to treat of in the <hi>Navy, viz.</hi> The Management of the Proviſion at Sea, but eſpecially on Shoar, for Sick and Wounded Men, by Hoſpitals, and Receptacles for them, with Phyſicians and Chirurgions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in which are large Expences, but not ſerving the Purpoſes intended, as I could wiſh it did, by reaſon of the Abuſes, for want of good Order: I being ſtreightened in time for the unhappy Succeſs of our Fleet in <hi>June,</hi> cauſed me to be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:47039:189"/>to the Seas, which took from me the opportunity of diſcourſing the whole Matter, as I intended; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now returned with Sickneſs, and Cold Weather, and ſhort Days, am forced to bind up the Matter thus roughly and indigeſted; being a little ambitious to crowd it in, in time, if it might be uſeful to this Winter's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations, and Preparations for next Summer; but if God permit, and that it may ſerve for the benefit of my King and Country, I will make a Second Edition; wherein I ſhall endeavour to detect and diſcover all the Errors and Corruptions in the whole Series and Conduct of the <hi>Navy,</hi> what have been obſerved by me, or infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of by others, for divers Years paſt, unto that preſent time; for as it is a great and important Affair, and of vaſt charges to the Nation, and likely of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, to be far greater, and of long
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:47039:190"/>continuance to be ſo: If we will procure and maintain the Nations Peace and Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, ſo ought it to be done in good Oeconomy, by Authentick, Honeſt, and Juſt proceedings, to make the burthen as eaſie and ſupportable for the Nation, as it is poſſible to be, <hi>viz.</hi> with good and anſwerable Rewards, to all that ſhall act therein; by being in Perils of Battels, perils by the Seas, impriſoments by Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Fatigues, Labours, Wants and Hardſhips, incident to the Affair; as alſo, to the more ſedate and quiet Juſticiaries, Rulers, Projectors, Overſeors, Clerks and Accompters in the ſame.</p>
            <p>Now if it have happened to be run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Errors in proceedings, and made di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fficult to be Traced, the ways Occult, and the depths not Fordable, by any, but by Men of ſuch Sizes and Statures, <hi>viz.</hi> parties, the Myſteries acted ſecluſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:47039:190"/>the Commands arbitrarily and charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably above Meaſure, and uncertain in its Actions; I ſay, if it be ſo, then will it appear ſo, in ſcanning the particulars, otherwiſe not: But if ſo, then may the Nation Groan under the heavy preſſures thereof: Nay, in fine, ſink under the Burthen, and never attain the end, for which ſo vaſt Treaſure and Blood, was, and is to be expended.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, I ſay, my ſecond Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall be to detect and diſcover the Errors, if any appear, ſuch as follow; by whome and what advantages have been made, by ſelling of Places and Preferments, by preferring of Parties, Sons, Relations, Marrying of Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Relatives into the Affair, and twiſting themſelves into, and about it, even as the Ivy about the Oak; and then appear with moſt verdure, in the
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:47039:191"/>Winter of Affliction; when the Oak hath no Leaf, nay, no Sap left, how and in what time grown Rich; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by undue Methods, Gifts, Bribes, cunning and ſecret Contracts, Purloin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Embezellings or Connivings, or by extorting Fees, by delays in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches, by encroachieg Affairs to be under their cognizances for Lucre, by Intricate, New, and unpractiſed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if any Perſon is aggrieved at their hard Meaſure done them, and are deſirous not to have it longer ſmother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or buried in Oblivion, or do bear ſo good a heart to their Country; that they would willingly have it proſper in Peace, Wealth, and Honour, or in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to Godward, not to conceal ſuch Abuſes, as are beſt known to few but themſelves, and be like the good
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:47039:191"/>antient <hi>Romans;</hi> who, altho' <hi>Heathens,</hi> yet deteſted the Robbing of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Treaſury, or Converting it to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Intereſt, knowing it to be the Barque in which all their Felicity was Freight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and therefore voluntarily detected and diſcovered, all that they found Guilty thereof: So that many of their great Miniſters, Generals, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, were often called to Account, and forced to Diſgorge their Ill gotten Wealth, as may be plentifully gathered out of their Hiſtories; for had they not been publick Spirited as they were, and to the ſhame of ſucceeding Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (Witneſs, after the Battel of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae</hi>) when <hi>Hannibal</hi> came over the <hi>Alpes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely they had never maintained their State againſt the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> much more ſpread their Plumes over
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:47039:192"/>the moſt part of the then known World: In doing of which, it was generally obſerved. That they exerciſed great Juſtice in their Conqueſts; the which was always acknowledged by the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed; and ſeldom but they were Gainers by being Conquered: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were in Idolatry, yet they were great Examples of Juſtice and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, abounding in good Morality in their Governments, and excelling in Commands, and Feats of Arms, to the reſt of the World: So alſo in their early Chriſtianity, they were exemplar in Piety, and Orthodox Opinions, to all other Churches; inſomuch, that they were often appealed to, for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of Controverſies; the which was a principal Ground for their Biſhop to aſſume the Oecumenical Title; but Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, long ſince, hath deſpoiled them of their Orthodoxy, and private
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:47039:192"/>Intereſt of their excellent Government, and publick Spiritedneſs.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, I ſay, if there be any yet alive, that bears ſuch a publick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as the former, towards his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and will adviſe me truly of any Matters of Moment, pertinent to the Purpoſes aforeſaid, let them direct their Letter to me, (thus:) To <hi>Henry Mayd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> to be put into his Box at the <hi>Poſt-Office General,</hi> in <hi>London:</hi> Whom I alſo adviſe, That they do pay the Poſtage, otherwiſe it will never come to my hands. The which I do to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the Tricks ſome Wanton Spirits will be apt to put upon me.</p>
            <p>Alſo I adviſe, that they do mention what Directions I ſhall make uſe of, if I ſhould have occaſion to Write to them ſome farther Queſtions in the ſaid
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:47039:193"/>Matter; the which being done, I ſhall give it a Faithful Quotation in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Treatiſe, whoſe Title ſhall be, (<hi>The Naval Cenſor Informed.</hi>) Wherein alſo I will not again let ſlip, that Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable, and Important Affair, of the Proviſion for Sick and Wounded Seamen on Board and Shoar; but I will diſcourſe it from Stem, to Stern.</p>
